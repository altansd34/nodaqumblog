A psalm is a sacred song or hymn comprising a collection of Bible verses. Believe in the words you sing because they are like a prayer for a loved one to come back. Below are<a href=#> Bible verses</a> to get your ex back:</p><ul><li>I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my soul loves. - <i>Song of Solomon 3:2</i></li><li>It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me. - <i>Song of Solomon 3:4</i></li><li>I am my beloved’s, and his desire is for me. - <i>Song of Solomon 7:10</i></li><li>Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. - <i>Genesis 2:24</i></li><li>I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My beloved is knocking: ‘Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one.’ - <i>Song of Solomon 5:2</i></li><li>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. - <i>1 Corinthians 13:4-8</i></li><li>My beloved is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies. Until the day break, and the shadows flee. - <i>Song of Solomon 2:16-17</i></li><li>The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls! Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you – if you find my beloved, what will you tell him? Tell him I am faint with love. - <i>Song of Solomon 5:7-9</i></li><li>Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate. - <i>Mark 10:9</i></li><li>If she is a wall, we will build towers of silver on her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar. - <i>Song of Solomon 8:9</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f9ef431ed5f88824.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting questions to ask your crush</span></p></a><h3>Prayer for someone to come back to God</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5636f14c92c16b92.jpg><p class=align-left>It hurts to see your loved ones abandon the Christian faith. Understand that not everyone shares your desire to live right with God, but you can stop them from drifting apart from God through prayers. Below are Bible verses to quote while<a href=#> praying for someone</a> to come back to God:</p><ul><li>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. - <i>John 10:10</i></li><li>'I will feed my flock and I will lead them to rest,' declares the Lord God. 'I will seek the lost, bring back the scattered, bind up the broken and strengthen the sick…' - <i>Ezekiel 34:15-16</i></li><li>What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? - <i>Luke 15:4</i></li><li>The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. - <i>Lamentations 3:22-23</i></li><li>He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. - <i>Philippians 1:6</i></li><li>What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost. -<i> Matthew 18:13-14</i></li><li>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him… - <i>John 6:44</i></li><li>Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God. - <i>John 1:12</i></li><li>Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me. - <i>Revelation 3:20</i></li><li>For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost. -<i> Luke 19:10</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2e49f27107ebbf87.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 sad quotes about love that will make you want to cry</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9e604d0e24d46140.jpg><h2>How do you pray for someone to come back?</h2><p class=align-left>You can pray, "Dear God, I ask for your assistance in this decision I am about to take.

Amen."</p><h2>Will God restore a broken relationship?</h2><p class=align-left>We should not give up on people because God does not give up on us.
