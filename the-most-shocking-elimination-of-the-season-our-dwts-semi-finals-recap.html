It turned out to be a strong improvement over her first; there were still several mistakes, but no freezing onstage like in several of her other performances.</p><p><strong>Carrie Ann:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Len:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Bruno:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Score:&nbsp;</strong>27/30</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Kel and Witney</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBSyYGmPAzo</p>Kel Mitchell and Witney Carson’s redemption tango on Dancing With the Stars Season 28</figure><p>With the help of Bruno, Kel worked to master the tango, a style that tripped him up a bit back in Week 1. This was another improvement, though at times it looked like he was walking around more than dancing. And we have to note that “Get Ready” isn’t really a fitting song for this style of dance, so kudos to Kel and Witney for doing their best with it!</p><p><strong>Carrie Ann:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Len:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Bruno:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Score:&nbsp;</strong>27/30</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Ally and Sasha</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_OUXOzB4s</p>Ally Brooke and Sasha Farber’s redemption Viennese Waltz on Dancing With the Stars Season 28</figure><p>Ally and Sasha were aided by Len during rehearsal for their second attempt at a Viennese Waltz. This was much more fluid in the first – though moreso out of hold than in – and we could feel the emotion in the performance. (Fun fact, the song, “Perfect” was actually Sasha and Emma’s wedding song!)</p><p><strong>Carrie Ann:&nbsp;</strong>10<br><strong>Len:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Bruno:&nbsp;</strong>10<br><strong>Score:&nbsp;</strong>29/30</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Hannah and Alan</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxZM5TLypSk</p>Hannah Brown and Alan Bersten’s redemption rumba on Dancing With the Stars Season 28</figure><p>Carrie Ann helped Hannah improve upon her rumba, but Hannah had trouble opening up to her about her feelings on the way she had been critiquing her throughout the competition. She later apologized – after an excellent performance to “Dancing with a Stranger” – and Carrie Ann told her that the comments were only meant to help her become a better dancer. (We understand that, but we don’t think Hannah needed to apologize for expressing her feelings in a respectful manner.)</p><p><strong>Carrie Ann:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Len:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Bruno:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Score:&nbsp;</strong>27/30</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>James and Emma</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nScT4tEPIUQ</p>James Van Der Beek and Emma Slater’s redemption cha-cha on Dancing With the Stars Season 28</figure><p>Len came in to help James and Emma prepare for their cha-cha to “Canned Heat” but the duo didn’t end up taking all of his advice. He wanted them to do away with the gimmicks that were a big part of their previous cha-cha but they didn’t really do that, and Carrie Ann commented on his posture issues. Still, we think the judges scored this dance too low in comparison to how other dances on the same level were scored this week.</p><p><strong>Carrie Ann:&nbsp;</strong>8<br><strong>Len:&nbsp;</strong>8<br><strong>Bruno:&nbsp;</strong>8<br><strong>Score:&nbsp;</strong>24/30</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Unlearned Style Round</h3><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Lauren and Gleb</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfrr3hni14w</p>Lauren Alaina and Gleb Savchenko’s Viennese Waltz on Dancing With the Stars Season 28</figure><p>Much of this second round turned out to be very emotional, and that started with Lauren and Gleb’s Viennese Waltz to “Humble and Kind”, a song that reminded Lauren of how her family always taught her to strive to be. This dance was breathtaking and without a doubt Lauren’s best of the season.</p><p><strong>Carrie Ann:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Len:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Bruno:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Score:&nbsp;</strong>27/30<br><strong>Total:</strong>&nbsp;54/60</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Kel and Witney</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpld9Ov-MCQ</p>Kel Mitchell and Witney Carson’s contemporary on Dancing With the Stars Season 28</figure><p>Kel and Witney danced a contemporary to “I Will Always Love You” in honor of a friend of Kel’s who died by gun violence at the age of 16.

The dance – set to “Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)” was energetic, action packed, and eve comedic. But as great as it was, there were several noticeable errors the judges somehow didn’t seem to catch; Ally was off timing quite a bit and occasionally had trouble keeping up.</p><p><strong>Carrie Ann:&nbsp;</strong>10<br><strong>Len:&nbsp;</strong>10<br><strong>Bruno:&nbsp;</strong>10<br><strong>Score:&nbsp;</strong>30/30<br><strong>Total:</strong>&nbsp;59/60</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>James and Emma</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts_w0T8Vr90</p>James Van Der Beek and Emma Slater’s foxtrot on Dancing With the Stars Season 28</figure><p>James and Emma danced a haunting, moving foxtrot to “Take Me to Church” which was made even more impactful by the news he shared in the video package beforehand: over the weekend, his wife miscarried the baby they <a href=#>announced was on the way</a> earlier in the season. James had almost dropped out of the competition, but his wife told him to keep going, and both he and Emma dropped to the floor and sobbed once the routine was finished.</p><p><strong>Carrie Ann:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Len:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Bruno:&nbsp;</strong>9<br><strong>Score:&nbsp;</strong>27/30<br><strong>Total:</strong>&nbsp;51/60</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Hannah and Alan</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGoHo0rSS9U</p>Hannah Brown and Alan Bersten’s contemporary on Dancing With the Stars Season 28</figure><p>Hannah has had an absolute roller-coaster of a year between The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, and now Dancing With the Stars, and she channeled all her emotions into her contemporary to “Lose You to Love Me”. This was one of the best dances we’ve seen all season…and yet somehow it didn’t get any 10’s.

This scenario was both heartbreaking and frustrating, since we can’t help but fsuspect the results would have been different if the scores given out were <a href=# class=broken_link>actually accurate to the quality of the dances.</a></p><p>The judges unanimously decided to save Ally, meaning <strong>James and Emma</strong> were eliminated from the competition in fifth place. Upon learning the final result, Ally immediately started sobbing and <a href=#>requested to let James take her place in the finals</a>. Both James and the show did not allow that to happen, but we have to say…we think they should have.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>An interview with Hannah Brown and Alan Bersten after Dancing With the Stars Season 28 Week 10</figure><p>While Ally is one of the best dancers in the competition, James was too, and this was his first time in the bottom two, likely due to devastating circumstances affecting his performances. Since this was Ally’s third time in the bottom, it’s pretty obvious she has basically no shot at winning and considering this as well as that the judges are supposed to take the entire season into account when choosing whom to save, we think it would have made more sense (and caused much less backlash, especially to Ally herself, who is already being cyberbullied) for them to keep James around for the finale over her.</p><p>Who do you think the judges should have saved this week, and should Ally have been able to bow out in favor of James?
