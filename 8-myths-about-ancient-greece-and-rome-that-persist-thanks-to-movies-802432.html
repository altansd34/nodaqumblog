It&nbsp;all results in&nbsp;creating misunderstandings about certain events and epochs in&nbsp;viewers’ minds.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;restore justice and tried to&nbsp;debunk some of&nbsp;the most widespread myths relating to&nbsp;the Antique epoch, which most of&nbsp;us still believe in&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;movies. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;tell you about the real appearance of&nbsp;Queen Olympias whose image was (almost) perfectly portrayed by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Angelina Jolie" data-link=tag>Angelina Jolie</a>.</p><p><h2>Helen of&nbsp;Troy was known for her slender body and bronze skin.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5aa/5be/f3fffd5c5ebf19c2647f43cb75.jpg><p>Many legends are devoted to&nbsp;the beauty of&nbsp;Helen of&nbsp;Troy. And it’s not surprising that in&nbsp;movies she is&nbsp;usually played by&nbsp;the most attractive actress at&nbsp;the time. Even though it’s not known for sure what features Helen possessed, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;confidently said that her beauty corresponded to&nbsp;the beauty canons of&nbsp;those times.</p><p>We&nbsp;can assume that Helen of&nbsp;Troy had a&nbsp;low forehead, a&nbsp;large straight nose (without highlighting the bridge of&nbsp;the nose), a&nbsp;slightly upturned chin, and a&nbsp;curvy shape. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>A&nbsp;History of&nbsp;the Fall of&nbsp;Troy</i></a>, which has been passed down to&nbsp;us <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>says</a> that the most beautiful of&nbsp;women had fair skin and hair, large eyes, and had a&nbsp;small mole between her eyebrows.</p><p><h2>The Spartans had short haircuts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/490/f4a/0f02245080b7fb2d4d571df003.jpg><p>Many people imagine Spartans as&nbsp;unkempt warriors who didn’t bother with how they looked at&nbsp;all. We&nbsp;were quite surprised to&nbsp;learn that Spartan men thoroughly took care of&nbsp;their appearance.</p><p>They paid special attention to&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>hair</a>, which they would braid. Mentions of&nbsp;thick, mid-back length hair can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;ancient sources. The popularity of&nbsp;this hairstyle is&nbsp;also proven by&nbsp;the images that have been passed down to&nbsp;us.</p><p><h2>Ancient Greek women wore elaborate dresses.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f03/974/55beb55adab9503c7d4654fce8.jpg><p>Most movies about Ancient Greece show&nbsp;us female characters in&nbsp;perfectly fitted elaborate dresses with seducing necklines. In&nbsp;reality, things were a&nbsp;bit different.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc3/760/370fa45d099a0b91289006d7e6.jpg><p>The main components of&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Ancient Greek outfit</a>, for both women and men, were tunics (peplos and chiton) and a&nbsp;cloak called himation. Peplos was a&nbsp;large rectangle of&nbsp;fabric, usually made of&nbsp;wool, folded over along the upper edge so&nbsp;that the overfold would reach the waist. It&nbsp;was fastened with a&nbsp;pin at&nbsp;the shoulders and was often secured with a&nbsp;special belt at&nbsp;the waistline. The sides of&nbsp;the garment were pinned or&nbsp;sewn to&nbsp;form a&nbsp;seam.</p><p>The chiton was made from much lighter fabric. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, it&nbsp;was imported linen. This fabric was sewn up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the sides, girded around the waist, and pinned or&nbsp;sewn at&nbsp;the shoulders. Female chiton would reach the floor, and the male chiton was a&nbsp;bit lower than knees.</p><p>Himation cloak was worn over tunics. It&nbsp;was either placed on&nbsp;one shoulder or&nbsp;worn like a&nbsp;stole. Women could also wear an&nbsp;epiblema shawl over the tunic. Fabrics were dyed in&nbsp;bright colors and decorated with elaborate embroidery.</p><p><h2>Women in&nbsp;Ancient Greece plucked their eyebrows and walked around with their hair down.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/721/904/5d8e07592e9318e294c8801500.jpg><p>In&nbsp;movies, Ancient Greek beauties are seen with their hair down nicely fluttering in&nbsp;the wind, accurately plucked brows, and gorgeous Mediterranean tan. But in&nbsp;reality, things were slightly different. Naturally <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>connected</a> eyebrows, fair skin, and long hair, which <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>married</a> Greek women gathered in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bun, were considered beautiful in&nbsp;Ancient Greece.</p><p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get closer to&nbsp;the ideal, women tried to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>whiten</a> their skin, color their brows with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>soot</a>, and attach false eyebrows made of&nbsp;dyed <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>goat hair</a> to&nbsp;their foreheads.</p><p><h2>Gladiators were athletic.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/baf/238/b781d85ca8a3a7a2a173c72fbb.jpg><p>Studies of&nbsp;the remains of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>gladiators</a> found in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mass grave indicate that they had a&nbsp;thick layer of&nbsp;subcutaneous fat. This led scientists to&nbsp;assume that the gladiators consumed very little animal protein, and their <a href=# title=diet data-link=tag>diet</a> was rich in&nbsp;carbohydrates, which they received through legumes and grains. This explains the funny nickname of&nbsp;Ancient Roman warriors&nbsp;— “barley eaters.”</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean authorities were trying to&nbsp;save money when feeding warriors. Based on&nbsp;the conditions in&nbsp;which they lived, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;assumed that the purpose of&nbsp;a&nbsp;plant-based diet was to&nbsp;increase the warriors’ stamina and resistance. In&nbsp;other words, gladiators were specifically fed carbohydrates so&nbsp;that they would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;fight better and have more endurance. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make up&nbsp;for their lack of&nbsp;calcium, the fighters would consume a&nbsp;special drink based on&nbsp;plant ash.</p><p><h2>Gladiators fought to&nbsp;the bitter end at&nbsp;the cost of&nbsp;their lives.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e9/845/2f06eb5b6b99ef4c99f929b2b5.jpg><p>Despite all the things we&nbsp;see in&nbsp;movies, gladiators didn’t always fight to&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>last inhale</a>. Moreover, this outcome of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fight was considered illegal. There were special rules for conducting fights, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;judges who were watching to&nbsp;make sure the rules were strictly followed. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;funds were invested in&nbsp;gladiators so&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn’t sensible to&nbsp;lose them so&nbsp;easily (from a&nbsp;financial point of&nbsp;view).</p><p><h2>All gladiators were slaves and they were kept in&nbsp;harsh conditions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/10d/be3/6479835191970324a5a5bbff34.png><p>Gladiators lived in&nbsp;decent conditions. They had special nutrition and even had access to&nbsp;the services of&nbsp;healers. The warriors were quite popular among locals and were actually kind of&nbsp;celebrities&nbsp;— their portraits would decorate public places, while little boys would dream about resembling the warriors fighting in&nbsp;the arena. In&nbsp;addition, not all gladiators came from the lowest class. There were volunteers among them&nbsp;— <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>free residents</a> who took the gladiatorial oath of&nbsp;their own free will, thereby exchanging personal freedom for a&nbsp;certain amount of&nbsp;money.</p><p>Fights were not the usual duels that are shown in&nbsp;the movies. They were a&nbsp;spectacular show with elaborate sets and props. Gladiators would wear intricate and often weird costumes that only vaguely resembled classic armor.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;gladiator’s destiny was determined by&nbsp;a&nbsp;thumb held up&nbsp;or&nbsp;down.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d1/2ad/4f43735f1ab7e65a0f168c26bd.jpg><p>There were some gestures that decided the future fate of&nbsp;the gladiator, but they had nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the thumb. To&nbsp;show mercy to&nbsp;the fighter, a&nbsp;hand was closed into a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>fist</a>.</p><p><h2>Bonus: What Queen Olympias looked in&nbsp;real life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dfc/896/8ae6e35475a59e5d406fdf0dae.jpg><p>Looking at&nbsp;the charming Angelina Jolie who played the mother of&nbsp;Alexander the Great, Queen Olympias, we&nbsp;start to&nbsp;involuntarily think that all women in&nbsp;the Ancient world had a&nbsp;perfect nose, plump lips, and chiseled cheekbones. However, the truth is&nbsp;that Queen Olympias was quite far from the image created by&nbsp;Hollywood moviemakers. Judging by&nbsp;the only image of&nbsp;Queen <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Olympias</a> that has survived to&nbsp;our modern-day, she had a&nbsp;classic Greek profile, a&nbsp;low forehead, an&nbsp;upturned chin, and a&nbsp;soft face.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these facts became a&nbsp;real discovery for you? Perhaps you are aware of&nbsp;other historical myths that are shown to&nbsp;us in&nbsp;movies? Please tell&nbsp;us about them in&nbsp;the comments!</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare social media appearance, Angelina Jolie paid a&nbsp;<a href=#>heartfelt tribute</a> to&nbsp;her late mother on&nbsp;her 73rd birthday, emphasizing the importance of&nbsp;regular health checkups and expressing her love for those who have lost loved ones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIVuuditn6xlkZe8tsCMmqWcoZWjwW6z0Z6cnJ1dlruledGopJ5lpJ2utXnPnqmsoaOperW0wKeirGWkpHquu9WinKxlaGV%2FdX%2BRaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1352941-audrey-murdick-biography-who-actor-jeff-dunhams-wife-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Audrey Murdick biography: Who is actor Jeff Dunhams wife?">&larr;
