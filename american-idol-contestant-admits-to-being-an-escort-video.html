The singer with the nickname “ET” turned heads with her unique take on Katy Perry’s hit song “E.T.”</strong> <strong>She was put through to the Hollywood round of the competition after a very vulnerable moment with the judges.</strong></p><p>In a resurfaced interview with Adam22 on his podcast “No Jumper,” Erika revealed that she is a former sex worker. She was joined by her friends Hayden and Richelle who spoke about getting into the business at a young age.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgyiCqak2Tg</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-american-idol-contestant-erika-perry-is-honest-about-sex-work>‘American Idol’ Contestant Erika Perry Is Honest About Sex Work</h2><p>At the time of the podcast, Erika spoke about how she is not really big on social media. Instead, she likes live streaming on the app Periscope. Adam was particularly interested in how Erika first started getting into sex work.</p><p>Erika was asked to detail her experiences in the past. She was 19 when a friend recommended her to go on the site Seeking Arrangements. This is a website for people looking for sugar daddies or sugar babies. “I f*cked this guy in Laguna Beach, it was like $1,000 and afterwards I was like yo I can’t believe how much money I made from f*cking someone.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW SHANE DAWSON LAUNCHED CATIE TURNER’S CAREER MORE THAN ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ EVER DID</a></strong></p><p>“I found all of these rich ass guys on Seeking Arrangments like directors…this guy that owned Live Nation, he was like a partner in it. He would get us like hotel rooms at the Roosevelt and we would just like have a party afterwards like after we would do the deed.” When asked to recall how she felt about the experience, Erika said that during this time she was “barred out” on drugs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CL3Cg-rAUvs/</p></figure><p>“For a while, we used to lowkey pimp her out and she would make $1000 every time she f*cked someone,” one of Erika’s friends chimed in.</p><p>“I had a main sugar daddy but he got shot in April of 2017 so ever since that happened I stopped doing any of that activity that was like illegal and sh*t” Erika added. Adult film star Lena The Plug later joined the interview.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-are-adam22-and-lena-the-plug>Who Are Adam22 And Lena The Plug?</h3><p>Adam22 is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an internet personality</a> and adult film star. He pioneered the popular BMX website “The Come Up” before jumping onto the podcast scene. The “No Jumper” podcast has 3.69 subscribers on YouTube and no topic is off-limits on the show.</p><p>Adam is in a relationship with Lena The Plug who often guest stars on the podcast. The pair just welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Parker. Adam often explains on the podcast that their relationship is very open, which allows them to explore physical relationships with other people. The interview with Erika and her friends was no exception.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CLnW86hhMOv/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-this-affect-her-time-in-the-competition>Will This Affect Her Time In The Competition?</h3><p>Truthfully Erika’s sex work past will probably not have any effect on her time in the competition. Erika is very open about who she is and we saw that during her audition. Her golden ticket to Hollywood was the perfect revenge for her ex-boyfriend that dumped her for being unmotivated.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>In 2008, former stripper David Hernandez was allowed to stay on the show after reports began surfacing that he worked at a Phoenix strip club. “We’ve had strippers on the show before,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">executive producer Ken Warwick said at the time.</a> “We’re never judgmental about people who do things like that.”</p><p>In the past, contestants have been subject to scandals that left viewers at home questioning whether or not they would remain in the competition. In 2003, contestant Frenchie Davis was actually&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>kicked off</a> of American Idol after her topless photos were discovered. Frenchie used the money from the photos to pay for college. Just a few seasons later, contestant Antonella Barba also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had her nude photos surface online.</a> However, she was allowed to remain in the competition.&nbsp;</p><p>American Idol&nbsp;certainly had strict rules at the beginning of the show’s inception when it came to contestants, explicit photos or anything of sexual nature. But, there is also a double standard on how these scandals are handled. The rules have since been loosened. We talk more about this in the What’s Hot Video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW ALEX MILLER’S EX RESPONDED TO HIS ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ SONG THAT WAS ABOUT HER</a></strong></p><p>This season fellow contestant Claudia Conway <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had her nude photos leaked </a>online.
