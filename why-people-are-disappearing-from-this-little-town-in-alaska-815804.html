If&nbsp;you live here, I’ll bet you say, “there’s no&nbsp;place like Nome.” Well maybe not. It’s cold &&nbsp;snowy here, and no&nbsp;roads connect this town with other settlements.</p><p>And with the onset of&nbsp;night, locals have disappeared here without a&nbsp;trace. Perhaps that’s why only about 3,500 people live here. Let’s investigate this case. People disappear in&nbsp;cities for assorted reasons.</p><p>But it&nbsp;was Nome who attracted the attention of&nbsp;the public. From 1960 to&nbsp;2004, some 24&nbsp;people went missing there. That number is&nbsp;statistically too big for such a&nbsp;small population. People just didn’t come home in&nbsp;the morning, and no&nbsp;one knew what had happened to&nbsp;them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/20a/7b4/b7041e50b18c4d8718ba412fc7.png><p>All the locals in&nbsp;small towns like Nome know each other. There are almost no&nbsp;strangers here, as&nbsp;it’s difficult to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;Nome. There are no&nbsp;roads and no&nbsp;ferry crossing. All roads from Nome break off and lead to&nbsp;beautiful natural landscapes unspoiled by&nbsp;human mammals. You can get there and back by&nbsp;plane. And this is&nbsp;not some passenger jet, but a&nbsp;small biplane.</p><p>Another way to&nbsp;get there is&nbsp;by&nbsp;snowmobile. By&nbsp;the way, Nome is&nbsp;the ultimate point of&nbsp;the famous dog sled race, the “Iditarod.” Also, you can pay locals from neighboring villages and towns to&nbsp;bring you to&nbsp;Nome by&nbsp;motorboat. But despite this, the town has become quite famous. The frequent disappearance of&nbsp;people finally got needed attention. The whole world found out about Nome, and in&nbsp;2009, Hollywood even made a&nbsp;movie about&nbsp;it.</p><p>For a&nbsp;long time, no&nbsp;one could solve the mystery. The police had no&nbsp;clues, no&nbsp;witnesses, nothing. There are long nights here in&nbsp;winter, and the air becomes so&nbsp;cold that the glass of&nbsp;water freezes in&nbsp;minutes. Snow can fall constantly. Therefore, if&nbsp;someone leaves the town at&nbsp;night, snow will sweep all traces away by&nbsp;the morning. Of&nbsp;course, people began to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with their theories.</p><p>The most popular one was about someone who took people away by&nbsp;force. The police didn’t find any evidence that some person could do&nbsp;it. So, if&nbsp;it’s not a&nbsp;human, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;some beast. And again, police found no&nbsp;evidence to&nbsp;support this version. After that, they started thinking that creatures from other planets caused these disappearances. Many locals were sure that the town was a&nbsp;popular destination for extraterrestrial spaceships. The plot of&nbsp;the Hollywood movie “The Fourth Kind” was based on&nbsp;this version.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f3a/4e4/6e90e45f129ab2d4f220028024.png><p>More time passed. Finally, the police and the FBI launched a&nbsp;large-scale investigation and&nbsp;— they uncovered the <a href=# title=truth data-link=tag>truth</a>. They realized that the stories about missing people were exaggerated. The popularity of&nbsp;Nome and the constant talk about fantastic things made people believe in&nbsp;the reality of&nbsp;these versions. Let’s assume that some of&nbsp;the disappearances were made&nbsp;up.</p><p>But still, many people are gone. What about them? The answer is&nbsp;bars and harsh weather. Entertainment venues are open at&nbsp;night. Some locals have fun, leave the bar, and go&nbsp;home. At&nbsp;this moment, a&nbsp;heavy snowstorm begins. Visibility is&nbsp;zero, and the strong wind knocks you down. This way, a&nbsp;person might simply get lost. And that’s it. The truth turned out stranger than most versions.</p><p>The Bermuda Triangle is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big area in&nbsp;the Atlantic, so&nbsp;the disappearance of&nbsp;ships and planes there seems not so&nbsp;surprising. But it’s much creepier when it&nbsp;happens on&nbsp;a&nbsp;lake. Let’s visit the Lake Michigan Triangle. It’s located between Michigan and Wisconsin. For a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;centuries, terrible things have been happening here. People put the same legends around this place as&nbsp;around the Bermuda Triangle.</p><p>They reported unexplained phenomena and saw flying objects above the lake’s surface. Some believe that the triangle is&nbsp;a&nbsp;time portal. Of&nbsp;course, no&nbsp;theories have been confirmed, but strange cases have occurred on&nbsp;the triangle territory. One happened in&nbsp;1950 when a&nbsp;Northwest Airlines plane with 108 passengers disappeared without a&nbsp;trace during a&nbsp;flight over the lake. Police officers saw a&nbsp;red light over the lake two hours after the plane’s last communication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cd5/bce/35d4a953a5898d324aaa0293c2.png><p>The aircraft probably crashed, but rescuers didn’t find any passengers or&nbsp;wreckage. All that’s left is&nbsp;just an&nbsp;oil stain on&nbsp;the water. Many ships and boats disappeared there, but one of&nbsp;the strangest cases occurred on&nbsp;April&nbsp;28, 1937. It&nbsp;was midnight. One ship was sailing through this lake. Captain George Donner went to&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;his cabin after a&nbsp;hard day’s work. Three hours later, the vessel was approaching the port.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the crew members went to&nbsp;the captain’s cabin to&nbsp;wake him&nbsp;up. The door was locked from the inside. The assistant knocked, but no&nbsp;one answered. When he&nbsp;suspected that something had happened to&nbsp;the captain, the assistant unlocked the door. He&nbsp;got into the cabin, but there was no&nbsp;captain there. He&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;have disappeared into thin air. The crew couldn’t find him. Since then, the eerie disappearance of&nbsp;Captain George Donner remains unexplained.</p><p>Meet David Paulides. In&nbsp;2008, he&nbsp;finished his career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;police officer and began to&nbsp;study the mysterious disappearance of&nbsp;people in&nbsp;Europe, the USA, and Canada. He&nbsp;found out that most people went missing in&nbsp;the U.S. National Parks. Over the past 150&nbsp;years, more than 1,100 tourists have vanished there. Many of&nbsp;them were experienced travelers who knew how to&nbsp;survive in&nbsp;harsh wild conditions.</p><p>David has written about these mysterious vanishings. He&nbsp;pointed out that some of&nbsp;them didn’t disappear but were found alive. They woke up&nbsp;somewhere in&nbsp;the forest and didn’t remember what had happened to&nbsp;them. The creepy detail of&nbsp;all these cases is&nbsp;that most missing persons were young. Another detail is&nbsp;that many went missing before hurricanes. There are too many riddles and not enough answers in&nbsp;this case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b54/8bb/dabfd95b7a99290bd09f490ad9.png><p>There’s the Sargasso Sea in&nbsp;the northern part of&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean. This is&nbsp;the only sea that doesn’t have shores on&nbsp;land. It’s called the sea only because is&nbsp;defined by&nbsp;ocean currents. Also, golden-brown algae grow on&nbsp;this area’s bottom, making it&nbsp;seem like an&nbsp;orange spot in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the endless ocean. The Sargasso Sea became famous because, in&nbsp;the 19th century, one of&nbsp;the most famous phantom ships in&nbsp;history sailed here.</p><p>In&nbsp;1872, a&nbsp;brigantine sailed through The Sargasso Sea. Its captain spotted another ship a&nbsp;few miles away. He&nbsp;lit a&nbsp;signal fire but received no&nbsp;response. Then the captain decided to&nbsp;sail closer to&nbsp;find out what had happened. On&nbsp;the hull of&nbsp;the mysterious ship was the name “Mary Celeste.” The captain of&nbsp;the brigantine and several crew members went on&nbsp;board.</p><p>They walked around the deck and looked into the cabins and the hold. Everything was in&nbsp;its place. But there were no&nbsp;people. The cargo in&nbsp;barrels remained untouched, so&nbsp;pirates didn’t attack the vessel. The only damaged thing on&nbsp;the ship were the sails. They were torn to&nbsp;shreds. All documents except the logbook were missing from the navigator’s cabin.</p><p>The last logbook entry was added on&nbsp;November&nbsp;24, 1872. The crew of&nbsp;the ship was never found. And this was one of&nbsp;many cases. In&nbsp;the 20th century, from the 60s to&nbsp;the 80s, there were many reports of&nbsp;empty boats and yachts floating on&nbsp;the sea. Also, some entire ships disappeared without a&nbsp;trace. All these cases still remain a&nbsp;mystery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/28f/4ed/889cca5eaa9070e21373370487.png><p>According to&nbsp;one version, the four-sided current forms water funnels. Whirlpools can quickly pull a&nbsp;ship into the depths of&nbsp;the sea. This explains the disappearance of&nbsp;boats. But what about cases when the vessel is&nbsp;still on&nbsp;the water without a&nbsp;crew?</p><p>Sometimes these whirlpools can create wind vortices. They’re like little tornadoes. What if&nbsp;these whirlwinds are powerful enough to&nbsp;throw people overboard and tear the sails? Yeah, the theory seems too fantastic. So, what do&nbsp;you think happened?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYypnKionJp6or7EZpuiq5Glvaat0aKloGWWp7yuedOhoKxlnJ7BtbjEZquor55itq95wKWYrKORYoVygZdpa2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./drive-in-movies-theaters-polling.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="With Traditional Theaters Closed, Drive-Ins Look to Draw Customers">&larr;
