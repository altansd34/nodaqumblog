This took him above the legendary Michael Jordan in terms of career earnings. Bryant also held the record for the highest-paying career in team sports. Players only exceed his revenues in individual sports such as Michael Schumacher (F1 Racing), Tiger Woods (golf) and Floyd Mayweather (Boxing).</p><p class=align-left>Kobe made his NBA debut when he signed a $3.5 million three-year contract with the Lakers. The team would go on to pay the star more than $300 million over the next seventeen years. Bryant was the NBA’s highest-paid player for six of his 20 career seasons and became only the second player in history to earn a salary exceeding $30 million in a single year (2013-2014). Michael Jordan first achieved this feat.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a6c57c564e83cbbe.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigeria's excess crude account drops again now left with $35m, presidency defend the withdrawals since 2015</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ad7d1dac16237b01.jpg><p class=align-left>The player voted against the 1999 NBA collective bargaining agreement which capped player salaries. He did this despite having started a paltry seven times in his career. The move was probably attributable to the player’s confidence that he could make a fortune with the NBA. Off the court, Bryant earned more than $350 million from deals made with top brands in motoring, food and entertainment.</p><p class=align-left>One of Bryant’s most prominent corporate endorsements was with Nike. In 2003, the sportswear company signed a $10 million-per-year deal with the Kobe. The company placed Bryant as Michael Jordan’s successor. The move became a success, particularly in Asian countries where Kobe’s style of play and the Lakers’ success pulled the crowds. What is perhaps most notable about the Nike endorsement was Kobe’s popularity in China. The player’s jersey was the NBA’s best-seller in China for a decade. Such was his allure among the Chinese that he became more popular in China than he was in the USA.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b709455c80f196ce.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Same price with land in Lagos: Massive reactions as diners spend N20.7m on food & drinks at restaurant</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Bryant’s appeal in the Chinese market helped him land advertising deals with Sin.com, Mercedes-Benz and the e-commerce firm Alibaba. The latter had Bryant-branded merchandise distributed through their online platforms. Kobe contributed significantly to the growth of the Lakers team during his 20-year career. When he joined the team in 1996, the franchise was valued at $200 million. During his exit, the value had risen to $2.6 billion.</p><h2>Corporate endorsements</h2><p class=align-left>The athlete had at a time, endorsement deals with the following companies.</p><h3>McDonald’s</h3><p class=align-left>In 2001, Bryant signed a $10 million <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">endorsement deal with McDonald’s</a>. The deal included appearances by the NBA star on the food giant’s commercials. Most fans can recall the ad featuring Kobe munching on a juicy-looking Big N’ Tasty. The franchise dropped the NBA star from their corporate deal in 2003 when he was charged with sexual assault.</p><p></p><h3>Nike</h3><p class=align-left>One lesser-known Kobe Bryant detail is his Adidas deal before signing for Nike. Adidas failed to take advantage of the player’s ascending profession. In 2003, Nike signed a ten-million-a-year agreement with the basketball superstar. The deal proved to be particularly fruitful for Nike who went on to sell more than $100 million worth of the star’s sneakers in the USA in 2015. It is also worth noting that Nike was among the corporate giants that did not drop the player after his sexual assault charges.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a7f4132a2f28f3dd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>From Obasanjo to Buhari: List of Loans Borrowed under Nigeria's 4 Presidents</span></p></a><h3>Nutella</h3><p class=align-left>The Italian-based Hazelnut spread company made a six-figure deal with Kobe in 2001. The firm used the basketball player in promotions that included magazines, in-store and online media. Additionally, life-size stands were used in supermarkets in 2002 to help promote the company’s products. In 2003, the company <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ended the endorsement deal</a> with Kobe citing his legal issues as the basis for the decision.</p><h3>Turkish Airlines</h3><p class=align-left>In 2010, the Lakers guard signed an international endorsement <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">deal with Turkish Airlines</a>. The carrier was focusing on its commitment towards flights from the USA. They viewed Bryant as the ultimate spokesperson on this agenda. The basketball star was involved in a promotional movie aired internationally in over 80 countries worldwide. The airline also included Bryant in print, digital and billboard advertisements.</p><h3>Hublot</h3><p class=align-left>In 2013, Kobe signed a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">personal endorsement</a> with the Swiss watch brand, Hublot. This made him a brand ambassador for the company alongside other sports stars such as Diego Maradona, Usain Bolt and Dwayne Wade. The company developed the Hublot King Power Black Mamba, a signature watch for Kobe Bryant, with the Mamba part being Kobe’s nickname.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a47376a6c1ae6675.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>World’s rarest and most expensive Funko Pop figurines of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The watch featured a snake design at nine o’clock and the player’s jersey number (24) at 6 o’clock. As part of the deal, the Swiss watchmaker would support the player’s charity (Kobe and Vanessa Family Foundation) by donating a portion of the revenue generated from the King Power Black Mamba watch sales.</p><h3>Mercedes Benz</h3><p class=align-left>In 2003, Mercedes-Benz created a Chinese website to promote its vehicles in China. The website created promotional material that included <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">commercials involving Kobe Bryant</a>. The site marketed the car’s safety, convenience and safety thanks to its small size and environmental friendliness. The brand’s use of Kobe was quite successful. Later in 2011, Mercedes-Benz would go on to release a limited edition of the car dubbed the <i>Black Mamba </i>model.</p><h2>Investments contributing to Kobe net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Kobe Bryant net worth 2020 is significantly composed of income generated from the player’s investments. The basketball star followed in the investment footsteps on legends such as Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. Here are the most significant investments the player has made over the years:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6c2cd3ecffdeab7c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>With staggering N7.7b net worth, Sadio Mane’s collection of cars worth staggering N256m (see exotic cars)</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6c38478304270f1f.png><h2>BodyArmor</h2><p class=align-left>In 2014, Bryant <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made a 10% investment</a> in a sports drink company BodyArmor. The company makes the BodyArmor drink, which it markets as a healthier investment to the popular Gatorade drink. The investment was worth $6 million. In 2018, beverage giant Coca-Cola purchased a minority share in BodyArmor. After the deal, Kobe’s investment was now worth $200 million. This represents more than 33 times the value of the original stake.</p><h3>Bryant Stibel</h3><p class=align-left>This is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">venture capital (VC) fund</a> started in 2013 by Kobe Bryant and Jeff Stibel. The fund provides strategic, operational and financial support to businesses focusing on media, data and technology. The two co-founders contributed $100 million to start the venture capital. To date, the VC fund has worked with companies such as Dell, House Canary, Legal Zoom, Scopely, RingDNA and The Players’ Tribune, amongst others.</p><h2>Kobe Bryant house and other properties</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8ff5f39d20e926fc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Samsung Galaxy A01 review: All the top details about the phone</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The former NBA star had various properties under his name acquired throughout his career.
