Sports such as shinty, curling, and, of course, the unique <a href=#>Scottish Highland Games</a> provide a wonderfully traditional activity for those looking for something a little different.</p><p><img alt="People playing golf in front of a large crowd in Scotland" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scotland.org/images/uploads/general/Sport_in_Scotland.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Photo credit: VisitScotland/Kenny Lam</p><p>There's also a wealth of opportunities for Scotland's people to become involved in sports. State-of-the-art facilities, such as at the Edinburgh International Climbing Arena at Ratho; a wide variety of dry slope and real snow ski centres, world-acclaimed mountain biking trails, excellent athletics complexes and a National Sailing Centre all combine to provide a sporting environment to rival many countries worldwide. There is also a surf resort due to open this Autumn near Edinburgh.</p><h2>Scottish Rugby</h2><p>Scottish Rugby has a long and rich history, which perhaps surprisingly, isn't dissimilar to football. Both rugby and football internationals were first played in Scotland. Both were Scotland V England. And both took place on a cricket ground.</p><p>Since Scotland took on England in Edinburgh in 1871 there has been keen rivalry between our two national teams. Each year we compete for the Calcutta Cup, a tradition that has been held every year since 1879, with the exception of both World Wars.</p><p>The home of Scottish rugby is the Scottish Gas Murrayfield Stadium, one of the great sporting stadiums&nbsp;of the world, and the largest sports venue in Scotland. Tours run both on and off season, but if you want to experience the real Murrayfield there's nothing to beat taking in a game. Face paint is optional, but our Scottish Saltire flag looks great on anyone.</p><h3>The Scottish Rugby Team</h3><p>Scotland's rugby teams compete&nbsp;in the annual Six Nations Championship and the men's team has competed in every Rugby World Cup since it was founded in 1987.&nbsp;</p><p><a class="btn-icon btn-icon--icon-left btn-icon--icon-external" href=#>Find out more about rugby in Scotland at VisitScotland.com</a></p><h2>Cycling in Scotland</h2><p>Scotland is a cyclist's paradise. There's so much to explore,&nbsp;historic towns, idyllic villages, mile after mile of beautiful countryside and breath-taking coastline.&nbsp;You can experience some of the most spectacular scenery in the world and this rugged landscape is perfect for mountain biking too.&nbsp;</p><p>It was perhaps our scenery -&nbsp;the rolling hills of Dumfries and Galloway, to be precise - that inspired local blacksmith, Kilpatrick MacMillan, to produce the world's first bicycle back in 1839. Granted, its rather basic form was far from the sleek cycles of today, but his wooden pedal-operated construction, was nevertheless the birth of the bike.</p><p>And since Kilpatrick's first ever 'test-drive' (the 68-mile journey to Glasgow), there's been no stopping us. We've clocked up an outstanding record in track events and produced one of the sport's most outstanding (and much-loved) sportsmen of all time, Chris Hoy.</p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scotland.org/images/uploads/general/visitscotland_29846837730_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Sir Chris Hoy</h3><p>Chris Hoy isn't just Scotland's most successful Olympian of all time, he's the most successful Olympic cyclist ever. The eleven-time world champion became the first British Olympian in 100 years to win three Golds in one games, at the&nbsp;Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008. And in 2012 he went on to take a further two Golds at the&nbsp;London games and set a world record in the process.</p><p>In recognition of his outstanding achievements, the velodrome in the new magnificent Emirates Arena built for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games has been named the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome.</p><p>The velodrome was&nbsp;also one of the venues for the inaugural&nbsp;<a href=#>2023 UCI Cycling World Championships</a>&nbsp;that took place in Glasgow and across Scotland.&nbsp;</p><p>But let's not forget two other great Scots: John Macadam and John Boyd Dunlop who pioneered smooth 'tarmac' roads and rubber wheels, respectively. Thanks to their pioneering endeavours we can all enjoy a smoother ride.</p><p><a class="btn-icon btn-icon--icon-left btn-icon--icon-external" href=#>Learn more&nbsp;about cycling in Scotland at VisitScotland.com</a></p><h2>Tennis in Scotland</h2><p>When you think of Scottish tennis one family immediately springs to mind: the Murrays. However, the Scottish connection with tennis dates back long before Judy Murray sent her two sons, Andy and Jamie, onto the practice courts. Tennis in Scotland can be traced all the way back to 1539, when King James V had some of the first tennis courts built at his Fife residence, Falkland Palace. Today these courts are the oldest real tennis courts still in use.</p><p>The Royal Court took two years to complete and, with the exception of two major renovations since, the jeu quarr (square court) has remained relatively unchanged ever since. Mary Queen of Scots and James VI (James I of England) are believed to have played here and the court's rich history has made it a Mecca for tennis players and fans alike.</p><h3>Sir Andy Murray</h3><p>Andy Murray is undoubtedly one of the modern game's greatest tennis stars. The man from Dunblane is the most successful tennis player in the history of the country, and is instantly recognisable on a global scale. Murray has spent time at the top of the rankings as the world's top tennis player and&nbsp;won 46&nbsp;career titles, including three Grand Slam titles and two Olympic singles gold medals. Murray was also an instrumental part of the British team who secured the 2015 Davis Cup for the first time since 1936, winning all 11 of his matches.</p><h3>Jamie Murray</h3><p>The older brother of Andy, Jamie, may not be as well known, but he also has an impressive tennis resume. Jamie is predominantly a doubles tennis player and was previously ranked the number one doubles player in the world. Jamie has won an impressive 37&nbsp;career titles, including five Grand Slam titles (three mixed doubles & two doubles) and was also part of the 2015 Davis Cup winning team alongside his brother.</p><h2>Scottish Football</h2><p>Football is, without question, the number one sport in Scotland and every great sport is not complete without a rivalry to match. Since the referee blew his whistle at the first international football match ever played, between Scotland and England in 1872, it's fair to say that there has been a healthy rivalry between our two nations. This landmark game, which was played on a cricket ground, was watched by some 4,000 spectators in Glasgow, with the game resulting in a respectable 0-0 draw.</p><p>Since then, our national team has played around the world, supported by legions of special fans, known affectionately as the 'Tartan Army'. When they're not singing us to victory in their kilted attire, they are winning awards and raising money for charity.</p><p><a href=#>Discover more about the power of football in Scotland</a></p><h3>The home of Scottish football</h3><p>The home ground of Scottish football is Hampden Park in Glasgow. A stadium which has witnessed some of football's most significant moments, and set the stage for Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi and U2. Not forgetting the spectacular opening ceremony at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.</p><p>Hampden also holds the European record for attendance at an international game: 149,415 people at, you guessed it, a Scotland V England match in 1937. Nowadays the stadium's&nbsp;capacity is 51,866 but the excitement on a big match day is every bit as momentous.</p><h2>Golf in Scotland</h2><p>Golf has been played in Scotland for more than six centuries. We're not just the 'Home of Golf', but the birthplace too. The first courses, clubs - even rules - were established here, so it's hardly surprising that it's one of our national pastimes.</p><p>In Scotland golf belongs to one and all. You don't have to be rich or famous to take to the green. Everyone is welcome to play on our courses - and our scenery is just as spectacular regardless of your ability.</p><p>There can surely be no finer place on earth to play a round than where it all began and Scotland&nbsp;boasts over 550 courses. We'll leave the tricky decision of where to tee-off first to you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjpqZqK2kYsCku9OlmKecX5jCrcDUq5xoq6Ckv7U%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-best-bohemian-rhapsody-performances-on-talent-shows-can-anyone-beat-adam-lambert.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Best Bohemian Rhapsody Performances on Talent Shows  Can Anyone Beat Adam Lambert?">&larr;
