Her story seems like a tragic one, despite not being recognized as so in Hollywood. In fact, it is not given much thought, such as stories of actresses like Judy Garland.

However, the pressure seemed to double for her because her mother, Yosene Balfour Ker, pushed her to do so much than she should have. She had to start working very early in life, and it seemed as though she had no choice in the decisions.</p><h2>Tuesday Weld profile summary</h2><ul><li><strong>Real name</strong>: Susan Ker Weld</li><li><strong>Nickname</strong>: Tuesday Weld</li><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: 27.08.1943</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 76 years</li><li><strong>Place of birth</strong>: New York City, New York, USA</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Zodiac sign</strong>: Virgo</li><li><strong>Profession</strong>: Actress, former model, and singer</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0b5973361f1ba314.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Yris Palmer's bio: age, plastic surgery, husband, where is she from?</span></p></a><h3>Tuesday Weld age and early life</h3><p class=align-left>How old is Tuesday Weld? Having been born on 27.08.1943, the actress is currently 76 years old. She is one of the many actresses that got into showbiz at an early age. She had to suffer the pressure of the industry, making her turn to illegal essences at an early age. While her story is not considered tragic, as many other actors' stories have, she still knows what it means to be one carrying a lot on her shoulders.</p><p class=align-left>Her father, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lathrop Motley Weld</a>, passed on when she was just 4 years old. While it is true that she would have had an easy time growing up if her mother had chosen to give her kids up to her husband's parents, she could not do it. The demand never to see her kids again refrained her from making such a decision. Her mother was an orphan from London. She moved to America, where she met Tuesday's privileged father. When he died, she had no choice but to push her daughter into modeling as a way of supporting her family. Tuesday Weld hot body made it possible for her to find success in this field quickly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7d99791d8d8c7e5c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33-year-old mum suffering from spinal tuberculosis finally walks after samaritans donated N6.6m for surgery</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She quickly became a successful child model and went on to pose for advertisements and mail-order catalogs. Due to her work and the burden of responsibility that started too early, she was estranged from her mother, Yosene, and her two elder siblings. She was forced to be the teen girl that got into adulthood before she was ready.</p><h3>Acting career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0b5973361f1ba314.jpg><p class=align-left>Having been forced to move into the modeling industry, Weld's mother did not stop at that. By the time she turned 12 years old, Weld debuted on her acting career. She was given a role in Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s movie <i>The Wrong Man</i>. Unfortunately for her, the pressure of the limelight was already overwhelming her. By the time she was 9 years old, she already suffered from a nervous breakdown. By the time she was 12 years old, she was already<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> addicted to alcohol</a>. In fact, she is believed to have attempted taking her life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8aece6f9e61ebc48.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sabrina Lynn biography: age, measurements, net worth, career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The pressure of having to take care of her mother and family was too much on her. Her mother seemed to push her too hard, even though she loved her so much. It appears as though a lot about her career got to her. Later in life, she turned down a lot of roles in movies that were to make it huge. She seemed to avoid such potential big hits for the mere reason that they would be popular.</p><p class=align-left>What she suffered as a kid may have contributed to her choices as an adult actress. She only accepted roles in movies that were not a big deal. Furthermore, her roles were not very significant. A good example would be the role she played in<i> Falling Down. </i>She acted as a nagging wife with neurotic tendencies. She would disturb her husband with a lot of needless concerns. In fact, her role would be removed, and no one would notice the difference.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/80f3b5c7eae9dbf4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why I quit journalism, become food vendor now making N10k daily, lady discloses in emotional video</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Her film debut was in 1956. She starred in a low-budget exploitation movie titled<i> Rock Rock Rock! </i>In fact, she became well-known for it<i>. </i>It<i> </i>is this same movie that pushed and convinced her about acting as a full-time career. Afterward, she appeared on TV in New York. It was later that she decided to go to Hollywood in 1958. From then, she appeared as part of the cast of <i>Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!</i> in 1958. It became her first breakthrough and was important in catapulting her career.</p><p class=align-left>Over time, she became one of Hollywood's teen queens. She played mainly precocious roles. She also led a wild private life that added to the entertainment of her fans. She was favored by critics who acknowledged her talent and directors who approved of her professionalism. By the time it was the late 1960s, she was able to outgrow her child/teenage image and find more demanding roles. She had been known for her sweet-16 roles for about 16 years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d6290ceba7081b64.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Actress Uche Elendu lambastes troll who accused her of lying about daughterâ€™s age</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, Tuesday Weld did not achieve first-magnitude stardom as many people would have expected. It may have had something to do with luck, but her selection of jobs could have contributed to this. She is said to have turned down <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> in 1967, <i>True Grit </i>in 1969, <i>Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice</i> in 1969. It has been described as her independence-loving mind, which made her shrink back from the restraints of superstardom instinctively.</p><p class=align-left>Despite shying away from great hits, she kept on performing well in films that did not receive much flair or success. From the mid-'70s onwards, she focused on made-for-TV movies. This may have been considered ironic considering the fact that she was once Hollywood's sweetheart. Her role in <i>Once Upon a Time in America</i> in 1984, and the most successful film, <i>Falling Down </i>in 1993 made her a big darling on the big screen.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5ce940f6bcca0c4f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Harper Hempel's bio, net worth, relationship with Jamal Murray</span></p></a><h3>Tuesday Weld movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7d99791d8d8c7e5c.jpg><p class=align-left>Actress Tuesday Weld is a brilliant actress.
