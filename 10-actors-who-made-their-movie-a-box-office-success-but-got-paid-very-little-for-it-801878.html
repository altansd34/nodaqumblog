They have to&nbsp;endure sleepless nights, get through long working hours, and meet high demands in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;their looks. These are just a&nbsp;few challenges they have to&nbsp;face in&nbsp;their profession. Of&nbsp;course, not everyone manages to&nbsp;immediately achieve a&nbsp;high level of&nbsp;compensation, but famous actors often receive multimillion-dollar checks. However, sometimes they have to&nbsp;work for minimum wage, and these low-paying roles become the most successful in&nbsp;their careers and remain in&nbsp;the memories of&nbsp;viewers for a&nbsp;long time.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;watch our favorite movies again and recall who of&nbsp;the famous actors were deprived of&nbsp;their fair share.</p><p><h2>Mel Gibson&nbsp;— Mad Max</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b88/25d/9e22885edda8badee282705462.jpg><p>The first part of&nbsp;the famous trilogy <a href=#>grossed</a> $100 million worldwide with a&nbsp;budget of&nbsp;<a href=#>$300,000</a>, $15,000 of&nbsp;which were <a href=#>paid</a> to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Mel Gibson" data-link=tag>Mel Gibson</a>. And it’s not such a&nbsp;small amount for the actor compared to&nbsp;the $400&nbsp;he received for his first <a href=#>role</a> in&nbsp;the movie, Summer City. However, it&nbsp;seems completely insignificant in&nbsp;comparison with his future paychecks.</p><p><h2>Seann William Scott&nbsp;— American Pie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ae/d1a/70ab8f59cb9a9b5816b3b2bce6.jpg><p>American Pie was Scott’s first serious <a href=#>movie</a> role, and he&nbsp;couldn’t ask for a&nbsp;big fee. He&nbsp;acted in&nbsp;the movie about teenagers for just $8,000 and<strong> got so&nbsp;in&nbsp;character that most of&nbsp;his lines were pure <a href=#>improvisation</a>. Thanks to&nbsp;his ideas</strong>, the movie became what we&nbsp;know and love, even today.</p><p><h2>Jeff Daniels&nbsp;— Dumb and Dumber</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/852/9d7/8b74b35f53a42e6d2066fab444.jpg><p>By&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;<a href=#>worked</a> on&nbsp;the movie, Dumb and Dumber, Jeff Daniels already had acting experience, but his fee for the movie was quite small at&nbsp;just $50,000. However, his colleague, Jim Carrey, earned $7&nbsp;million.</p><p>At&nbsp;the same time, it’s worth taking into account the <a href=#>fact</a> that Daniels made the same contribution to&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;cheerful atmosphere for this cult comedy, and his jokes were in&nbsp;no&nbsp;way inferior to&nbsp;Carrey’s. The screen time was also split almost equally between the actors.</p><p><h2>Michelle Williams&nbsp;— All the Money in&nbsp;the World</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/04a/efa/16f01d53dcb51a034b887cccb1.jpg><p>When the movie was almost finished, some scenes had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hastily reshot because the starring actor had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>replaced</a>. Michelle Williams, like some other actors, was willing to&nbsp;act in&nbsp;the reshoots for free, but they were still paid.</p><p>Michelle Williams was paid less than $1,000, while her colleagues, like Mark Wahlberg, received $1.5&nbsp;million. It&nbsp;all ended with a&nbsp;<a href=#>scandal</a> because people couldn’t understand why the talented actress who was a&nbsp;multiple <a href=#>award</a><a href=#>-winner</a> and the movie’s main heroine could get such laughable compensation.</p><p><h2>Jamie Lee Curtis&nbsp;— Halloween</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/401/42c/3ac63e551c86a3bf68a18a906c.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jamie Lee Curtis" data-link=tag>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> is&nbsp;known to&nbsp;the world as&nbsp;the ultimate <a href=#>scream queen</a> thanks to&nbsp;her <a href=#>roles</a> in&nbsp;horror movies. The most successful franchise the actress took part in&nbsp;was <a href=# title=Halloween data-link=tag>Halloween</a>. She was cast in&nbsp;the film thanks to&nbsp;the fact that <strong>she was the <a href=#>daughter</a> of&nbsp;<a href=#>Psycho</a> actress Janet Leigh</strong>.</p><p>At&nbsp;that time, Curtis was just an&nbsp;aspiring actress, so&nbsp;she <a href=#>earned</a> only $8,000. Who knew that she would become one of&nbsp;the most famous actresses in&nbsp;this genre and would participate in&nbsp;many parts of&nbsp;this franchise?</p><p><h2>Patricia Arquette&nbsp;— Boyhood</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e7/fcb/67392d5bf880a6c0ac0d1e3889.jpg><p>We&nbsp;know Patricia from many movies, but Boyhood brought her fame, thanks to&nbsp;which she <a href=#>won</a> a&nbsp;Golden Globe and an&nbsp;<a href=# title=Oscar data-link=tag>Oscar</a>. This epic coming-of-age drama was <a href=#>produced</a> over the course of&nbsp;12&nbsp;years and earned more than $57 million worldwide. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her interviews, Arquette <a href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;paid more money to&nbsp;my&nbsp;babysitter and my&nbsp;dog walker than&nbsp;I made on&nbsp;Boyhood.”</p><p><h2>Barkhad Abdi&nbsp;— Captain Phillips</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/578/5bb/026d6a5e82900e917c7618873a.jpg><p>Barkhad Abdi <strong>became an&nbsp;actor thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lucky coincidence</strong>. He&nbsp;was an&nbsp;immigrant from Somalia, and film director Paul Greengrass was looking for Somali men for his movie. After being cast, Barkhad <a href=#>got</a> one of&nbsp;the main roles and played alongside Tom Hanks. He&nbsp;was nominated for many awards but was paid just $65,000 for his appearance in&nbsp;the film and returned to&nbsp;working in&nbsp;his brother’s shop afterward. <strong>Sony Pictures had to&nbsp;<a href=#>rent</a> clothes and a&nbsp;car for him to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;official events.</strong></p><p><h2>Julia Roberts&nbsp;— Pretty Woman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dce/dc7/42a7d7518dae29a931db3fbdab.jpg><p>Initially, Julia Roberts <strong>wasn’t chosen for the main role</strong> because Disney management didn’t <a href=#>like</a> her. But other candidates couldn’t take part in&nbsp;the film for one reason or&nbsp;another, so&nbsp;the young actress got the job with a&nbsp;fee of&nbsp;just $300,000. Thanks to&nbsp;Roberts, the film became iconic, and she is&nbsp;now one of&nbsp;the <a href=#>highest-paid actresses</a> in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2>Bruce Campbell&nbsp;— Evil Dead</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b6b/c5b/a3dd94531596bbc63cbadad8e5.jpg><p>We&nbsp;know Bruce Campbell thanks to&nbsp;the movie, Evil Dead. Not only did he&nbsp;play the main character, Ash Williams, but he&nbsp;<strong>also <a href=#>produced</a> the movie.</strong> However, he&nbsp;received the same small salary as&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;the cast: they were all paid just $100&nbsp;a <a href=#>week</a>.</p><p><h2>John Travolta&nbsp;— Pulp Fiction</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/039/e98/32a166593ba51a7f27c7fc0f7c.jpg><p>Vincent Vega, who was portrayed by&nbsp;John Travolta, became an&nbsp;iconic character. And a&nbsp;huge reason for this was due to&nbsp;the actor’s charm. Viewers finally saw that Travolta had dramatic acting potential, and his <a href=#>career</a> took off afterward. However, <strong>Travolta’s fee <a href=#>was</a> quite small, just $150,000</strong>. But without him, <strong>the movie would’ve been quite different.</strong></p><p><h2>Michèle Mercier&nbsp;— Angélique</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df1/2c4/8c8f8459fe987e6fd9f6b42f4e.jpg><p>For Mercier, the role of&nbsp;Angélique was both lucky and cursed. When she was cast for the role, she was still an&nbsp;aspiring actress, despite the fact that she already had more than <a href=#>20&nbsp;movies</a> in&nbsp;her filmography, but she was popular mainly in&nbsp;Italy. The movie about the French beauty instantly brought her international fame, but her fee was quite small. She was paid <strong>only <a href=#>50,000 francs</a> per movie, although <a href=#>millions</a> of&nbsp;people around the world </strong>came to&nbsp;movie theatres to&nbsp;see Mercier.</p><p>Such a&nbsp;low fee became one of&nbsp;the reasons why the actress refused to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;further parts of&nbsp;the franchise. But finding new roles became even more difficult because people thought of&nbsp;her only as&nbsp;Angélique. In&nbsp;1999, Mercier even had to&nbsp;sell her personal belongings and all the heroine’s dresses, which she had once bought from the studio, due to&nbsp;her financial problems.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Fifty Shades of&nbsp;Grey actors received a&nbsp;small fee in&nbsp;the beginning.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/792/722/786ce75fd99d1d23e648cf4f59.jpg><p>The actors of&nbsp;the scandalous melodrama probably didn’t even suspect how famous they would become after the release of&nbsp;the movie. The film was controversial and many stars had refused to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;it, given the plot and the provocative scenes, but Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan went for it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;very modest <a href=#>fee</a> of&nbsp;just $250,000&nbsp;each.</p><p>The film earned more than $500 million worldwide, which is&nbsp;why the starring actors decided to&nbsp;<a href=#>renegotiate</a> the terms of&nbsp;their contracts. Of&nbsp;course, they were entitled to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiered structure of&nbsp;bonuses, but that wasn’t enough. Eventually, Johnson and Dornan <a href=#>asked</a> for a&nbsp;6-figure fee for the next 2&nbsp;parts of&nbsp;the franchise.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these famous characters do&nbsp;you love the most?
