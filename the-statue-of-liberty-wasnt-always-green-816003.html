The statue originally consisted of&nbsp;copper skin over the iron framework, making Lady Liberty appear a&nbsp;bright bronze color. Over the years, the copper began to&nbsp;oxidize, forming a&nbsp;protective layer called patina and creating a&nbsp;bright green hue. It&nbsp;took 30&nbsp;years for Lady Liberty to&nbsp;turn fully green.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c43/cbd/e4cb795ba1a8142141c5ea3c3c.jpeg><p>If&nbsp;the statue’s sculptor Bartholdi had it&nbsp;his way, Lady Liberty would never have been green&nbsp;— or&nbsp;even copper for that matter. The architect originally intended for the statue to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;lighthouse. In&nbsp;order for the lighthouse to&nbsp;be&nbsp;visible at&nbsp;night, Bartholdi planned to&nbsp;wrap the entire sculpture in&nbsp;gold leaf so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;would glow under the moonlight. This idea was rejected because it&nbsp;would’ve been far too expensive.</p><p>New York isn’t the only city to&nbsp;have its own Lady Liberty. You can find a&nbsp;much smaller version of&nbsp;the sculpture within the entrance hall to&nbsp;this famous <a href=# title=museum data-link=tag>museum</a> in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a>. This mini Lady Liberty was crafted by&nbsp;Bartholdi shortly after the original statue was erected for the 1900 Paris Exposition, a&nbsp;world fair held in&nbsp;France to&nbsp;celebrate the achievements of&nbsp;the previous century.</p><p>There’s gold in&nbsp;the metal the torch is&nbsp;made&nbsp;of. But if&nbsp;you look closely at&nbsp;it, you can see that it’s not the original torch that was brought here from France. About 100 years after the statue was installed, in&nbsp;1986, frequent rains and leaking water damaged the torch, and it&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;replaced.</p><p>At&nbsp;first, the old torch was displayed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;museum piece just inside the pedestal at&nbsp;the entrance. But recently, a&nbsp;new museum was built on&nbsp;the island, and the torch was moved there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/f24/c03/cb3b6e548eb3c8101ca6e0b924.jpeg><p>Some rumors about the statue say that Thomas Edison once wanted to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;speak. He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;huge phonograph in&nbsp;it, the sound of&nbsp;which could’ve been heard even in&nbsp;Manhattan. Good thing this never became reality. It&nbsp;would’ve been unbearably noisy on&nbsp;the island, and it&nbsp;would’ve sounded creepy.</p><p>Lady Liberty arrived from France on&nbsp;June&nbsp;17, 1885, in&nbsp;over 300 copper pieces in&nbsp;214 crates on&nbsp;the French ship Isere. It&nbsp;got into a&nbsp;terrible <a href=# title=storm data-link=tag>storm</a> and nearly sank. The Statue could have been moved to&nbsp;Baltimore, Boston, San Francisco, or&nbsp;Philadelphia. When New York didn’t have enough money to&nbsp;pay for the pedestal, these cities were willing to&nbsp;pay for the whole construction on&nbsp;condition of&nbsp;its relocation.</p><p>In&nbsp;1983, David Copperfield made the Statue disappear in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;crowd. They were sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;platform and the illusionist opened the curtain and showed them a&nbsp;big empty nothing in&nbsp;Lady Liberty’s place. In&nbsp;reality, the platform was slowly moving until it&nbsp;reached an&nbsp;angle from which the Statue couldn’t be&nbsp;seen behind one of&nbsp;the towers on&nbsp;the platform.</p><p>It’s believed that Charlotte, the mother of&nbsp;Frederic Bartholdi who was the Statue’s sculptor, became the model for its face. In&nbsp;1876, one French senator met her at&nbsp;the opera. He&nbsp;was shocked to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;live version of&nbsp;the Statue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/ade/278/8211a45afe98314dde80146762.jpeg><p>Some people think that Lady Liberty has a&nbsp;male face! According to&nbsp;them, it&nbsp;doesn’t look much like Bartholdi’s mother, but is&nbsp;a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;his brother! Frederic knew his face in&nbsp;every detail because he&nbsp;spent hours watching his brother at&nbsp;the hospital.</p><p>In&nbsp;the summer, the crown of&nbsp;the Statue becomes a&nbsp;temporary home for peregrine falcons. In&nbsp;the winter, owls are often seen there. Many other bird species migrate through Liberty State Park in&nbsp;the spring and fall months, including rare ones.</p><p>The last official residents of&nbsp;Liberty Island were the family of&nbsp;the superintendent of&nbsp;the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty. They had free housing at&nbsp;Liberty Island until their home was damaged in&nbsp;a&nbsp;2012&nbsp;hurricane.</p><p>At&nbsp;305 feet tall, when the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty was first built, it&nbsp;was the tallest iron structure in&nbsp;the world. Of&nbsp;course, that has now been far surpassed. The tallest building in&nbsp;the world, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, has a&nbsp;staggering height of&nbsp;over 2,700&nbsp;feet. That’s almost 9&nbsp;times taller than the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty.</p><p>The famous sculpture is&nbsp;weatherproof. Lady Liberty is&nbsp;struck by&nbsp;around 600 bolts of&nbsp;lightning every year since she was built. Some photographers have been lucky enough to&nbsp;catch these moments. She’s also survived hurricanes, ocean changes, and countless storms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/473/5cc/7e583a552fb44fa099ab5766ae.jpeg><p>The Statue of&nbsp;Liberty was designed to&nbsp;sway in&nbsp;the wind. During heavy winds, Lady Liberty can sway up&nbsp;to&nbsp;three inches in&nbsp;any direction, and its torch can sway five.</p><p>The weight of&nbsp;the statue can be&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;the weight of&nbsp;an&nbsp;empty Boeing 737. But this is&nbsp;only the outer skin of&nbsp;Lady Liberty. The metal construction inside, that is&nbsp;stairs, pylons, and supports weigh another 125&nbsp;tons. It’s like a&nbsp;small train locomotive. And the concrete base underneath weighs an&nbsp;impressive 27,000&nbsp;tons. That’s like a&nbsp;fleet of&nbsp;11,000 heavy SUVs or&nbsp;180 of&nbsp;the largest blue whales.</p><p>It&nbsp;took the workers 4&nbsp;months to&nbsp;fully assemble the statue on&nbsp;the finished pedestal. The statue is&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;the pedestal, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;lifted separately. And the entire metal structure inside can be&nbsp;seen through the glass ceiling of&nbsp;the pedestal. Although interior work was still in&nbsp;progress, you could already see the statue in&nbsp;all its beauty.</p><p>There’s a&nbsp;star-shaped base on&nbsp;the ground. It’s the remains of&nbsp;the former Fort Wood on&nbsp;the island. Next comes the granite pedestal, which has its own observation deck, and the statue itself.</p><p>Visiting Lady Liberty is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good workout. Visitors need to&nbsp;climb 354 steps to&nbsp;reach the crown. Inside the crown, there are 25&nbsp;windows, providing stunning panoramic views of&nbsp;New York City. It’s also much smaller than you thought it&nbsp;would&nbsp;be. Lady Liberty’s crown is&nbsp;adorned with seven individual spikes. Some say these spikes represent the seven oceans and continents of&nbsp;the world, bearing the universal concept of&nbsp;liberty. Others think they represent rays of&nbsp;sunshine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/8f5/abe/5ee6c851b69d792be780186a74.jpeg><p>The Statue of&nbsp;Liberty was first assembled near Parc Monceau, in&nbsp;Paris. The locals loved her so&nbsp;much they called her “Lady of&nbsp;the Park”. They used 300 different kinds of&nbsp;hammers to&nbsp;shape the copper, which was the weight of&nbsp;an&nbsp;African elephant, into the statue.</p><p>The statue was finished thanks to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the first crowdfunding campaigns in&nbsp;history. First, French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, who created the Statue, raised funds in&nbsp;his country to&nbsp;build&nbsp;it. Then, over 120,000 donors in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US joined in&nbsp;to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;pedestal.</p><p>Lady Liberty received a&nbsp;new torch with a&nbsp;flame during the 1984&nbsp;renovation. It’s made of&nbsp;copper and covered in&nbsp;24k gold leaf. The original torch had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;replaced because of&nbsp;water leakage. You can now see it&nbsp;at&nbsp;the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty Museum.</p><p>During the same renovation, the Statue got a&nbsp;nose patch and a&nbsp;better supporting structure. The original one was slightly imperfect. They found out the head had been installed two feet off-center, and the arm was 18&nbsp;inches away from the body.</p><p>The Lady of&nbsp;the Harbor is&nbsp;as&nbsp;tall as&nbsp;a&nbsp;22-story building. Her face is&nbsp;as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Queen Size Bed, and her hands are twice as&nbsp;long. If&nbsp;this Lady ever wanted to&nbsp;buy shoes, they’d have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;size 879. Her waistline is&nbsp;as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;a&nbsp;double-decker bus, and she is&nbsp;about five times as&nbsp;heavy as&nbsp;a&nbsp;T. rex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/43f/fe4/81c8d95e00996aa4cda0f9861c.jpeg><p>It’s practically impossible to&nbsp;see it&nbsp;when you visit, but Lady Liberty is&nbsp;standing on&nbsp;a&nbsp;broken shackle and chains. They stand for breaking free. Her right foot is&nbsp;slightly raised. Bartholdi was thinking of&nbsp;putting chains in&nbsp;the statue’s hand first but ended up&nbsp;giving her a&nbsp;tablet instead. The pedestal now hosts a&nbsp;museum where you can learn all about the Statue’s history.</p><p>From there&nbsp;on, you can climb a&nbsp;double metal narrow staircase of&nbsp;354 steps to&nbsp;the crown. It’s so&nbsp;small it&nbsp;only fits 10&nbsp;people at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time, but it&nbsp;has an&nbsp;impressive 25&nbsp;windows. The torch is&nbsp;closed for visitors.</p><p>Bartholdi was assisted in&nbsp;his designs of&nbsp;Lady Liberty’s structure by&nbsp;Gustave Eiffel. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;famous structural engineer who&nbsp;— you might have guessed from his name&nbsp;— is&nbsp;famous for designing the Eiffel Tower. Eiffel designed the framework and structures that support the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty.</p><p>Liberty Island was only named so&nbsp;in&nbsp;1956, 70&nbsp;years after the Statue had been installed. Until then, it&nbsp;was known as&nbsp;Great Oyster Island, then Bedlow Island after a&nbsp;Dutch man who owned&nbsp;it. At&nbsp;some point, it&nbsp;was also called Love Island, by&nbsp;order of&nbsp;Governor Francis Lovelace. You can’t travel to&nbsp;Liberty Island by&nbsp;a&nbsp;private ship and dock it&nbsp;there. The only allowed official way to&nbsp;get there is&nbsp;by&nbsp;Statue Cruises ferry.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYysq5qspZp6sLKMpaCbnaKpxm7DwKylrWWRocSixdJmnqudlaN6eX2VaWdsZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-x-factor-uk.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The X Factor UK News, Videos &amp;amp; Recaps">&larr;
