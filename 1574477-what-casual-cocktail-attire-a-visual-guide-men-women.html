The time for the drink was named cocktail hour, and then there was a formal dress code for it. Over the years, the cocktail dress code has evolved and been used in different events, including weddings and other social events. Which casual cocktail attire is suitable for you?</p><h2 id=1574477-casual-cocktail-attire class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Casual cocktail attire</h2><p class=align-left>When it comes to <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1165500-nigerian-traditional-wear-designs-men-trends.html href=#>fashion sense</a>, <a href=#>people</a> have their unique preferences.

You have different combinations, from long dresses to jumpsuits, to achieve an elegant, timeless appearance. If you seemingly cannot figure out what is right for you, here is a guide on selecting your attire.</p><h4 id=1574477-dresses class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Dresses</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/66c0e0b678a1f8a3.png><p class=align-left>Dresses are a perfect choice for a cocktail party. It does not necessarily have to be a long dress, but one that ends just above the knees will do. You <a href=#>can</a> also opt for a slitted dress but ensure that it is a sizable slit. You should also consider a high-quality fabric with a colourful shade. Dresses are also suitable casual cocktail attire for weddings.</p><h4 id=1574477-jumpsuits class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Jumpsuits</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1bc62f09658f0517.png><p class=align-left>Jumpsuits are an option if you do not like rocking dresses but still want a simple, timeless look. They bring out your easy yet sophisticated nature that dedicates your class. You can enhance your appearance by choosing conspicuous colours and donning accessories such as necklaces and waist belts. However, be careful not to select jumpsuits that are too casual.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c0a5cf30e7b7ddda.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is garden party attire?
