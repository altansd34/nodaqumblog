The words “then” and “than” are one of those bothersome pairs. Knowing when to use “then” and “than” can be confusing when you begin <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning English</a> as a second language. So here is our handy guide to when to use “then” and “than” and identifying the differences between the two. We’ll also give you a few&nbsp; of examples of “then” vs “than” in sentences to demonstrate how native English speakers use these words.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=When-to-use-“then”>When to use “then”</h2><p>“Then” is an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adverb</a> which is used to indicate the time that you are referring to in a sentence and can often stand in for the phrase “at that time”.</p><p>For instance, if I were talking about something that happened in the past I might say:</p><ul><li>“We took a family holiday to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paris</a> in 2004. Jack was still only a baby <strong>then</strong>.”</li></ul><p>“Then” indicates that Jack was only a baby “at the time” of the holiday. Similarly:</p><ul><li>“Yesterday I discovered that tomatoes are fruit. Until <strong>then,</strong> I thought they were vegetables.”</li><li>“After Henry XIII died in 1547, his son Edward <strong>then</strong> succeeded him as king of England.”</li></ul><p>You can also use “then” to indicate that something will occur in the future:</p><ul><li>“I will finish university next year and <strong>then</strong> I will find a job in the city.”</li><li>“When the kids are back at school <strong>then</strong> I will have time to myself.”</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><p>You can also use “then” to indicate that something will happen only as a consequence of something else happening:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>“If you finish your dinner, <strong>then</strong> you can have dessert.”</li><li>“If I win the lottery <strong>then </strong>I will buy a house by the sea.”</li></ul><p>“Then” is also often used repeatedly to indicate a sequence of events:</p><ul><li>“First of all I mixed together the eggs, <strong>then</strong> I added the milk, <strong>then</strong> some salt and pepper and finally, I added in the cheese.”</li><li>“My first class is history, <strong>then</strong> I have chemistry and <strong>then</strong> French.”</li></ul><p>In the continuous present you might say:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>“Fiona is doing her yoga now, then she is going to the pub to meet Alfie and <strong>then</strong> they are going to a party in town together.”</li></ul><p>“Then” can also occasionally be used as a modal particle, which doesn’t add any meaning but softens the language. When speaking to a child you might ask: “And what’s your name then?”.&nbsp; “Then” and “and” add no meaning but they make the sentence more gentle and child-friendly.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=When-to-use-“than”>When to use “than”</h2><p>“Than” is a conjunction (i.e. a word that connects clauses or sentences, or coordinates words in the same clause) or a preposition that is used in order to draw comparisons between people or things. For example:</p><ul><li>“Joe has more apples <strong>than</strong> George.”</li><li>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">London</a> has a larger population <strong>than</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Berlin</a>.”</li><li>“Susan is older <strong>than</strong> her brother Robert, but Anthony is the eldest in the family.”</li><li>“For my summer holidays, I would rather visit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barcelona</a> <strong>than</strong> go back to Rome.”</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Master these tricky homonyms</h2><p>Hopefully, you now have a good idea of when to use “then” and “than”, and are ready to start writing your own practice sentences. If you can keep in mind that “then” is normally used to indicate time and “than” is always used for drawing a comparison, it will be plain sailing for you and you won’t be at any risk of mixing up the two. With a small bit of practice and repetition, you will be using them completely naturally in no time!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
