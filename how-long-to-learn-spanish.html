Well, the most sensible answer is that it depends on each learner’s circumstances. Your goals, schedule, current knowledge and chosen learning method matter. These factors are important, no matter what language you decide to study.</p><p>So, specifically, how long to learn Spanish? We’ve taken it upon ourselves to give you a comprehensive idea of how long it might actually take to learn this beautiful – and arguably one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best – languages to learn.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-spanish>How long does it take to learn Spanish?</h2><p>One of the first questions you’re probably asking yourself, even before your first hola, is: How long would it take to learn Spanish if I’m starting from zero?</p><p>As we’ll explore below, the speed of language learning depends on many personal factors. There is no way around it. Start by setting realistic expectations, making the journey much more enjoyable and manageable.</p><p>Let’s look at some statistics to get an idea of how long it might take us to learn Spanish. The U.S. Foreign Service Institute <a href=# id=073c47a5-6d35-464a-867f-8645ea8d6df0-link>1</a> estimates that it takes <strong>600-750 class hours</strong> to reach professional working proficiency in this language. If you study for one hour a day, it might take you a year and a half to become fluent. However, if you bump that up to two or three hours a day, you’ll be fluent much faster.</p><p>Nevertheless, this isn’t the whole story. A language isn’t learned only in the classroom. Things like how often we practice, the methods we use and what other languages we already speak can all influence how fast we progress. So, while these statistics can serve as a guideline, our personal experiences will vary.</p><p><strong>*Note</strong>: The U.S. Foreign Service Institute estimate is based on the experiences of native-level English speakers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-difficult-is-it-to-learn-spanish>How difficult is it to learn Spanish?</h2><p>Spanish is generally considered one of the easier languages for English speakers to learn due to shared vocabulary and grammar. But fluency still requires dedicated effort and we know it can take up to 700 class hours to reach proficiency in Spanish. Regardless of this, our personal circumstances and goals can impact our learning journey. Indeed, these factors may determine how challenging it might be and how long it could take for us to achieve our desired level of fluency.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-targeted-proficiency-level-and-learning-objectives>1. Targeted proficiency level and learning objectives</h3><p>First, we need to think about what level of proficiency we’d like to reach in Spanish. This goal will impact how long we will spend learning the language.</p><p>If you’re not sure what your goal is, think about what is motivating you to learn Spanish. Are you looking to move to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish-speaking country</a> for work? Then you should aim for a high level (C1). Are you learning the language to speak with your Spanish-speaking friends? You will likely be happy with a conversational level (B1). Would you like to ditch Google Translate on your next getaway to Spain? A basic level (A2) should be enough.</p><p>To give you a specific idea of the <a href=#>language levels</a>, we’ve put together a simple table explaining what you can expect to achieve at each level:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody readability=3.4788273615635><tr><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Learning expectation</strong></td></tr><tr readability=1.6078431372549><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish A1</a></td><td>Knowledge of basic grammar and vocabulary</td></tr><tr readability=1.7402597402597><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish A2</a></td><td>Ability to create/understand basic sentences in everyday situations</td></tr><tr readability=1.6428571428571><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish B1</a></td><td>Ability to have simple and short conversations</td></tr><tr readability=1.5652173913043><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish B2</a></td><td>Ability to have casual conversations</td></tr><tr><td>Spanish C1</td><td>Fully conversational</td></tr><tr><td>Spanish C2</td><td>Full fluency</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-other-languages>2. Other languages</h3><p>Another crucial factor in our learning journey is the languages we already speak–both our native language and any additional ones. The closer these languages are to Spanish, the easier it might be for us to learn it. And vice versa.</p><p>For instance, a native Japanese speaker might take longer to reach a proficient level of Spanish compared to a native English speaker. This is partly because English and Spanish share many words of Latin origin, like arquitecto (architect) or inspiración (inspiration). Japanese shares very few <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cognates with Spanish</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The similarities between Spanish and the other languages we speak have a significant impact. Not only in terms of vocabulary, but grammar structure, alphabet, phonetics and so on.</p><p>Which languages are the most similar to Spanish? Romance languages like French, Portuguese and Italian. Those who speak any of these languages proficiently will likely find Spanish easier to learn than other students.</p><p>On the flip side, speakers of Germanic languages like English or Dutch might find Spanish slightly more challenging due to differences in verb conjugation rules. Native speakers of Chinese dialects may have difficulty with certain Spanish consonant pronunciation. However, as mentioned above, when a native language shares similar vocabulary with Latin origins, this can make learning <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish as a second language</a> easier than expected!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-time-and-effort-investment>3. Time and effort investment</h3><p>This may seem obvious, but it’s worth mentioning. The speed at which you learn Spanish depends a lot on how much time and effort you invest in your studies, both inside and outside the (online) classroom.</p><p>If you only practice during class, your progress will be much slower than if you dedicate extra time to independent study. As we highlighted earlier, English speakers might take about a year and a half to become proficient in Spanish with one hour of study per day. What if we invest three hours a day? Then we could potentially reach that level in about six months.</p><p>So, it’s important not only to focus on your classes but also to put in as much practice time as you can on your own.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-learning-method>4. Learning method</h3><p>The learning method, or how we learn, also matters. A pragmatic learning method makes a big difference. Traditional methods like memorization have fallen out of favor. Real usage methods tend to help language learners pick up Spanish much faster.&nbsp;</p><p>With so many options, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed when choosing a learning method or strategy. Should we take in-person lessons, join group classes or opt for private tutoring? And how can we boost our progress outside of class hours? The answers to these questions will depend on what works best for you..</p><p>Here are some factors to consider when choosing your method or strategy:</p><ul><li><strong>Schedule</strong>. Consistency is key for faster progress, so we should look for options that fit our routine. Online platforms like Lingoda offer flexible schedules, allowing you to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learn Spanish</a> from native-level speakers when it suits you best – this keeps you committed!</li><li><strong>Learning style.</strong> Everyone learns differently. Some find music and lyrics great for learning vocabulary, while others prefer visuals like flashcards. Find what clicks for you and make your journey more effective.</li><li><strong>Access to native speakers</strong>. Learning from native Spanish speakers is invaluable. They can teach you everyday vocabulary, slang, correct pronunciation and so much more. Plus, their tailored feedback will help you improve faster. If you live in a country with Spanish speakers, you will have an easier time improving your listening skills.</li><li><strong>Group or one-on-one lessons</strong>. Larger groups may slow down learning due to time constraints, as there are fewer opportunities to address individual questions. At Lingoda, we offer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">private Spanish lessons</a> and small-sized group lessons to accelerate your learning!</li><li><strong>Online or in-person</strong>. If you want to maximize your time, we suggest going for an online platform. Online classes offer flexible scheduling, eliminate the burden of a commute and can include efficient programs such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lingoda’s Sprint</a>, which is specifically designed to speed up your journey.</li></ul><p>In short: the key to faster learning is to find what works best for you and your schedule!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start learning with Lingoda today</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-your-own-motivation-and-discipline>5. Your own motivation and discipline</h3><p>We couldn’t finish this list without giving you a pep talk! Learning a new language is not a simple prospect, but it is possible. Yes, all those new words, grammar structures and unique sounds may seem challenging at first. But, learning a new language will open so many new doors in your life that you will see the value almost immediately.</p><p>Your own personal motivation to learn Spanish will be the thing that keeps you going. The more motivated you are, the more disciplined you can be – and the faster you’ll progress. So, whether you’re embarking on this journey because you’re aiming to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">boost your career</a> or because you simply find Spanish beautiful, think of all you’ll achieve when you reach your fluency goal.</p><p>Here are some things you can do to stay motivated:</p><ul><li><strong>Track your progress</strong>. Realizing and celebrating how far you’ve come will give you the fuel to keep going.</li><li><strong>Find what works for you</strong>. Enjoying the learning process keeps you on track. It’s essential that you find methods and strategies that you find stimulating and fun. This could be anime, music videos or even dating apps.</li><li><strong>Fall in love with the culture</strong>. Spanish-speaking countries are home to some of the most vibrant cultures in the world. With such a wide range of incredible foods, colorful celebrations and stunning must-see locations, it’s easy to fall in love with places like Peru, Argentina or Mexico. Diving into these cultures and their traditions is a great way to stay inspired.</li><li><strong>Share your journey with friends and family</strong>. Tell your loved ones about your language quest – they’ll cheer you on and keep you accountable. Just imagine how proud they’ll be as they watch you progress! They may even introduce you to native-speaking acquaintances to practice Spanish with.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-learning-spanish-bonus-tips>Learning Spanish: Bonus tips</h2><p>While achieving fluency in Spanish can vary depending on your learning style, estimates range from 600-750 class hours. Aside from joining classes, staying motivated and finding the right learning method for you, here are other tips you can follow to boost your learning speed:</p><ul><li><strong>Use technology to immerse yourself in the language.</strong> Surrounding yourself with Spanish is guaranteed to accelerate your progress. Technology can be your friend here. Stream <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish-speaking movies</a> and series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">read news in Spanish</a>, listen to Spanish music and podcasts. Switch your device settings to Spanish. This will help you learn new vocabulary, practice pronunciation and grasp common sentence structures.</li><li><strong>Practice consistently.</strong> Discipline is key. Dedicate time to your studies every day. Review what you’ve learned, practice vocabulary, find a language exchange buddy and incorporate Spanish into your daily routines.</li><li><strong>Stay realistic.</strong> Learning a new language can be challenging. Be patient with yourself. Don’t get discouraged if you make a mistake or if you’re not progressing as fast as you hoped. Mistakes are opportunities to learn. Embrace feedback, be kind to yourself and keep pushing forward.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-learn-spanish-fast>Learn Spanish fast</h2><p>Yes, there are some general pointers on how long it might take someone to learn Spanish from scratch.
