There are some obvious signs like when someone doesn’t say “please” and “thank you,” when they don’t know proper table etiquette, or&nbsp;when they use rude words. But this is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;façade.</p><p>Psychologists say that manners are <a href=#>more</a> than that. They are about values that can change, be&nbsp;subjective, and depend on&nbsp;the cultural context.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have made a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;9&nbsp;signs that reveal whether a&nbsp;person has bad manners, even if&nbsp;they are trying to&nbsp;hide&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>People that don’t apologize and don’t admit their faults</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/19b/4c6/e89fbf5dd0bc733e72aa546c65.jpg><p>Admitting to&nbsp;your faults is&nbsp;<a href=#>not easy</a>. And it’s even harder to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;public, in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;everyone. But it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;easier for people that were taught to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this in&nbsp;childhood. Bad parenting and bad examples make people get stuck in&nbsp;one paradigm: I’m always right and that won’t change.</p><ul><li>So&nbsp;true on&nbsp;the apologizing part! Once I&nbsp;was visiting family and my&nbsp;uncle got mad at&nbsp;my&nbsp;cousin for something, but a&nbsp;little later on&nbsp;he&nbsp;came and apologized. I&nbsp;was shocked, absolutely flabbergasted that this was possible, a&nbsp;powerful parent figure that actually tells you when they were in&nbsp;the wrong. That uncle isn’t perfect, but&nbsp;I gained a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;respect for him, and not necessarily envy in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad way, but somewhat wishful that&nbsp;I could have the same, rather than people pushing blame on&nbsp;you habitually. <a href=#>©&nbsp;1D2D3D&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>People that don’t clean up&nbsp;after themselves</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b8/388/de3eac5306be0fa7b357bacf8d.jpg><p>The habit of&nbsp;living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;slight mess may <a href=#>point</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;special state of&nbsp;mind or&nbsp;certain <a href=# title=psychological data-link=tag>psychological</a> problems. But when it’s not about your personal space, there’s only one conclusion: a&nbsp;person is&nbsp;so&nbsp;selfish that they don’t even think about others.

Their son comes and says, “I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I need a&nbsp;car. Can you buy me&nbsp;one?” I&nbsp;expected them to&nbsp;get really angry, but instead, they said proudly, “He’s such a&nbsp;good boy. He&nbsp;asks for the right things. He&nbsp;just needs a&nbsp;driver’s license. We’ve found enough money for the driver’s lessons.
