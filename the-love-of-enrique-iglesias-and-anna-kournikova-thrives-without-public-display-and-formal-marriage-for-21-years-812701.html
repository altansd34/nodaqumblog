They rarely attend public events, give few interviews, and rarely share family photos on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> (though this has changed somewhat in&nbsp;recent years). This has earned them a&nbsp;reputation as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most private couples in&nbsp;the entertainment industry. Despite their secrecy, they have been happily living together for 21&nbsp;years, raising three children, and serving as&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspiration to&nbsp;other celebrities and ordinary people alike as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model couple.</p><p>Even before she met Enrique Iglesias, Anna Kournikova gained recognition as&nbsp;a&nbsp;renowned tennis player. Although she hadn’t won any singles titles, she had <a href=#>climbed</a> to&nbsp;No.&nbsp;8&nbsp;worldwide by&nbsp;2000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef8/cb2/8d6b685ec59713ce9dfb87fd22.jpg><p>AFP / East News</p><p>Enrique Iglesias was a&nbsp;highly acclaimed singer known for his popularity in&nbsp;Spain and beyond. His single “Bailamos” was released and quickly skyrocketed to&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the charts, becoming a&nbsp;number-one <a href=#>hit</a> in&nbsp;the United States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e0/989/9491ca51d883fe04240cd0820f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2001, Enrique Iglesias unveiled his second English album, “Escape”. For the <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> video of&nbsp;the album’s first single, also titled “Escape”, director Dave Meyers enlisted the captivating presence of&nbsp;tennis star Anna Kournikova. Iglesias later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> her as&nbsp;“independent, beautiful, and funny”.</p><p>The music video featured some steamy scenes, including passionate kisses between Enrique and Anna. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;behind-the-scenes <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a>, Iglesias even joked that he&nbsp;didn’t need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;skilled actor to&nbsp;make their on-screen chemistry believable.</p><p>Predictably, after the video’s release, the media immediately speculated that Enrique and Anna were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dating</a>. Reporters eagerly pursued them, hoping to&nbsp;catch glimpses of&nbsp;the rumored couple together. However, they never confirmed their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> and avoided public appearances as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/037/66e/110b195b5fb9114f8f73e16081.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2002, Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova finally <a href=#>confirmed</a> their relationship when they publicly appeared at&nbsp;the MTV Awards. They were all smiles, holding hands and posing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple on&nbsp;the red carpet for the first time.</p><p>Following their appearance at&nbsp;the MTV Awards, Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova moved in&nbsp;together in&nbsp;Miami, where Enrique owned properties. They deliberately tried to&nbsp;keep their relationship private and away from the public eye. Interestingly, despite the passage of&nbsp;time, there has been no&nbsp;information regarding their marital status or&nbsp;any <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a> ceremony, maintaining a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;mystery around their relationship.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, Anna <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “[Marriage] isn’t important to&nbsp;me. I’m in&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy relationship&nbsp;— that’s all that matters. I&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;commitment. I&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;being open and trusting each other and respecting each other completely.”</p><p>Despite numerous rumors over the years about Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova breaking&nbsp;up, no&nbsp;official confirmations were ever made. In&nbsp;2011, Iglesias expressed his desire to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>keep</a> his personal life as&nbsp;private as&nbsp;possible, particularly when both partners are famous and in&nbsp;the spotlight.</p><p>During an&nbsp;interview on&nbsp;CBS’ Sunday Morning Show in&nbsp;2011, Iglesias <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that after being together for so&nbsp;long, a&nbsp;wedding wouldn’t make a&nbsp;difference and wouldn’t necessarily make them happier. “When you have been with someone for such a&nbsp;long time, I&nbsp;don’t think a&nbsp;wedding is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;difference,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Kournikova also spoke about their relationship on&nbsp;The Graham Norton Show, revealing that they faced ordinary-couple issues just like anyone else. When asked if&nbsp;Iglesias left his wet towels lying around, she humorously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replied</a>, “Yeah, and you find underwear, you know, everywhere and dirty socks and everything.”</p><p>In&nbsp;December 2017, Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova welcomed their <a href=#>first</a> children, twins named Nicholas and Lucy. Surprisingly, their fans ignored Anna’s pregnancy, and Iglesias made the announcement during one of&nbsp;his concerts in&nbsp;Budapest. “I&nbsp;became a&nbsp;father 12&nbsp;weeks ago,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> with the crowd. “And I&nbsp;can absolutely tell you two things, without the slightest doubt, I&nbsp;love my&nbsp;babies. Actually, three things, I&nbsp;love my&nbsp;girl, and&nbsp;I love you guys for being here tonight.”</p><p>Following the birth of&nbsp;their twins, the usually secretive couple surprised their fans by&nbsp;sharing adorable family photos on&nbsp;their social media accounts. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;departure from their usual private approach, and fans were delighted to&nbsp;catch glimpses of&nbsp;their <a href=# title="family life" data-link=tag>family life</a> with the twins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bde/fa9/ad70f550afae57df1a3aa4d928.jpg><p>In&nbsp;January 2020, Anna Kournikova gave birth to&nbsp;their <a href=#>third</a> child, a&nbsp;daughter named Mary. Coincidentally, around the same time, she <a href=#>updated</a> her Instagram profile name to&nbsp;include “Iglesias”, sparking rumors that she and Enrique had finally tied the knot.</p><p>Interestingly, when journalists inquired about Enrique’s involvement in&nbsp;diaper duty for his three children, he&nbsp;<a href=#>responded</a>, “I&nbsp;actually&nbsp;do. I’m pretty hands-on.”</p><p>He&nbsp;further <a href=#>revealed</a> his aspirations for his children, wanting them to&nbsp;follow in&nbsp;his mother’s footsteps and pursue sports instead of&nbsp;music like him. “I&nbsp;can honestly tell you, if&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;pick one, definitely sports. I&nbsp;love sports. I&nbsp;love golf, I&nbsp;love tennis, and&nbsp;I would not mind seeing one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;little girls play tennis.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/337/2f7/981fac5640bc078ccf470d7b63.jpg><p>Enrique <a href=#>shared</a> that his children have different reactions to&nbsp;his songs, “Whenever they hear one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;songs, they can actually recognize my&nbsp;voice, which is&nbsp;pretty cool. But when they watch ‘Escape’, I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;does throw them off a&nbsp;little bit. ‘What is&nbsp;Mom doing there?’ you know, ‘with Dad’ you know? ‘When was this?’ It’s actually incredible to&nbsp;watch the expression on&nbsp;their faces. It’s pretty cool.”</p><p>Despite occasionally sharing cute photos and videos of&nbsp;her family on&nbsp;social media, Anna and Enrique remain private about their personal lives, unlike other celebrities who openly discuss their personal matters with reporters.</p><p>In&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;her career, Anna <a href=#>retired</a> from professional tennis in&nbsp;2003 due to&nbsp;severe back and spinal issues, including a&nbsp;herniated disk. However, she has occasionally played in&nbsp;exhibitions and doubles matches. Currently, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;41, Anna has transitioned into being an&nbsp;American television personality.</p><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;47, Enrique <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continues</a> to&nbsp;release new singles, perform at&nbsp;concerts, and maintain his popularity as&nbsp;a&nbsp;musician. He&nbsp;has earned the honorary title of&nbsp;“King of&nbsp;Latin Pop” for his contributions to&nbsp;the music industry.</p><p>Enrique says the key to&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy family relationship is&nbsp;spending quality time together. He&nbsp;believes that controlling his schedule and ensuring that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not away from home for more than two weeks in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row has been beneficial for his family life. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview with the British press, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> how fortunate he&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;have the flexibility to&nbsp;prioritize his family time amidst his busy career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e16/c64/478f22567782fa669a995bd5d7.jpg><p>Here are some more stories of&nbsp;love that lasts for decades:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYylpq%2BdXaSzbrHNq6CqrZVitqi4xKygmqtdlrulecCnpZplm6TCs7rIpKavmV2ptbO11Z6qZq%2BZqbWwwdNmp66anJ6wbrDIrKelmalirq%2BwjJ%2Bmq6WRoXqurdGroJqflWKzsL6Ma2hmsZWWv7R5l2ppcGhhZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./state-of-workers-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The State of Workers Report 2023">&larr;
