They use these patterns to&nbsp;cover any <a href=# title=germs data-link=tag>germs</a> and stains on&nbsp;the seats. The brighter the color and the more patterned it&nbsp;is, the harder it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;for a&nbsp;passenger to&nbsp;notice any stains and get grossed out.</p><p>Also, the patterns are usually so&nbsp;ugly that no&nbsp;one even wants to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;them for long enough to&nbsp;spot any stains. So&nbsp;yeah, the pattern is&nbsp;there to&nbsp;make you look away, and if&nbsp;you look, to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;less noticeable. No&nbsp;bus will ever have plain white seats, that’s a&nbsp;guarantee!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d38/09b/253a0350028eea0f39777058fe.png><p>Just a&nbsp;few more bus-related questions to&nbsp;answer. Like, why don’t buses have seatbelts? Buses are overall way safer than cars because they were designed this way. The idea behind this is&nbsp;called “compartmentalization,” meaning that the seats have high backs that absorb energy. The seats are also placed close to&nbsp;one another, so&nbsp;there is&nbsp;less space to&nbsp;move in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;an&nbsp;impact. Also, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bus, the passengers sit pretty high off the ground, and, in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;collision, the force is&nbsp;absorbed by&nbsp;the bus’s deck and not by&nbsp;people inside.</p><p>On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, a&nbsp;bus is&nbsp;way heavier than most other vehicles, and even if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;collision, it&nbsp;distributes the force way differently than a&nbsp;regular car. Due to&nbsp;its weight, a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;force is&nbsp;absorbed, and bus passengers don’t experience much crush force. So, small and light buses that can’t distribute the force as&nbsp;well actually do&nbsp;require seatbelts. And we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;remember that buses drive slowly, which minimizes the risk of&nbsp;an&nbsp;accident overall.</p><p>We&nbsp;all know that school buses are yellow, but why? It’s for visibility reasons. Yellow is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most easily recognized colors, and, for a&nbsp;human eye, yellow is&nbsp;even more visible than, say, red. So, school buses are yellow to&nbsp;make them more distinctive. Also, yellow is&nbsp;visible in&nbsp;the dark, in&nbsp;fog, and on&nbsp;a&nbsp;rainy day. Actually, the color of&nbsp;the bus isn’t really a&nbsp;true yellow&nbsp;— it&nbsp;also has a&nbsp;hint of&nbsp;orange. This shade even has an&nbsp;official name: “National School Bus Glossy Yellow.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e12/979/298c6d534d9c952d6f9a006762.png><p>By&nbsp;the way, taxi cabs are yellow for the same reason&nbsp;— to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more visible in&nbsp;any weather conditions. Also, buses have huge steering wheels, and&nbsp;I finally learned why. Buses are bigger than regular cars, and they’re also way heavier. So, it’s harder to&nbsp;turn a&nbsp;bus around, and way more strength is&nbsp;required to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;than when you drive a&nbsp;car. A&nbsp;bigger steering wheel that has a&nbsp;bigger radius allows the driver to&nbsp;turn the vehicle more easily, and it&nbsp;requires less force than if&nbsp;the wheel were smaller. Trucks have big steering wheels for the same reason.</p><p>But have you seen those stuffed toys are that some trucks have attached in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;them? Turns out, it’s just a&nbsp;way for truck drivers to&nbsp;customize their vehicles. It’s like a&nbsp;mascot that speaks about the truck or&nbsp;the driver. It’s also a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;communicate to&nbsp;the world that the truck driver isn’t all scary and tough, but a&nbsp;soft and harmless person that you shouldn’t be&nbsp;afraid&nbsp;of. At&nbsp;least that’s how some truck drivers explain&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;Asia, there’s also a&nbsp;belief that road accidents are caused by&nbsp;ghosts, and hanging toys are a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;distract the ghosts from causing harm to&nbsp;the truck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5c6/c4a/46467f592da4aaa35628d61648.png><p>Ever been on&nbsp;a&nbsp;road trip? If&nbsp;you’re not the driver, all you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;just sit in&nbsp;one place and do&nbsp;basically nothing for hours. Doesn’t sound like a&nbsp;hard task, but some people find it&nbsp;terribly exhausting, and because of&nbsp;this, they resent road trips. Why do&nbsp;they get so&nbsp;tired? Well, sitting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;car isn’t like sitting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;chair. The brain doesn’t relax. Instead, it&nbsp;controls everything that’s going&nbsp;on, accounting for movements and making sure that you maintain the right posture.</p><p>Your brain is&nbsp;constantly working, exchanging bits of&nbsp;information with your muscles, so&nbsp;your body is&nbsp;working. Some people get tired because of&nbsp;this. If&nbsp;you aren’t doing much, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean that your body isn’t doing much. Train rides are way more tolerable because trains don’t stop or&nbsp;change speed as&nbsp;often as&nbsp;cars&nbsp;do, so&nbsp;the body is&nbsp;more relaxed, and train trips are way more tolerable for people who aren’t fans of&nbsp;road trips.</p><p>Another mystery is&nbsp;why it’s way harder to&nbsp;stand still in&nbsp;the same spot for 30&nbsp;minutes in&nbsp;comparison&nbsp;to, for example, walking for 30&nbsp;minutes. Again, it&nbsp;sounds like you’re not doing anything when you’re standing, so&nbsp;why is&nbsp;it&nbsp;so&nbsp;tiring? Well, standing is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty hard task for your body. When standing, the muscles in&nbsp;your legs work very hard to&nbsp;support the mass of&nbsp;your whole body. If&nbsp;you are standing, there are not many muscles working, and only a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;them have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;all the work. When walking, there are more muscles working at&nbsp;the same time, so&nbsp;it’s easier. Also, when standing, both of&nbsp;your legs are working without stopping. But when walking, each of&nbsp;them gets a&nbsp;tiny break every time you step using the other leg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4de/2a3/79545e5a5cb5d9ebb626d2a198.png><p>Why is&nbsp;it&nbsp;that the same book can have different covers? There are several reasons for this. First, the cover may vary because of&nbsp;the target audience. An&nbsp;edition of&nbsp;a&nbsp;book that is&nbsp;being marketed to&nbsp;older people is&nbsp;usually different from the edition aimed at&nbsp;younger people, with the one for younger people usually being brighter and cuter. The cover can also depend on&nbsp;the country the book is&nbsp;being sold&nbsp;in, trying to&nbsp;attract as&nbsp;many buyers as&nbsp;possible based on&nbsp;the tastes of&nbsp;the population.</p><p>Next, books vary from edition to&nbsp;edition. At&nbsp;first, a&nbsp;book is&nbsp;printed in&nbsp;hardcover in&nbsp;small quantities to&nbsp;see how it’ll do&nbsp;on&nbsp;the market. If&nbsp;the book is&nbsp;a&nbsp;relative success, there is&nbsp;another edition printed, often in&nbsp;trade paperback. The design of&nbsp;the cover is&nbsp;usually updated with every edition. Also, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;book has a&nbsp;movie based on&nbsp;it, there is&nbsp;usually another edition that follows. This edition will take advantage of&nbsp;the movie and use a&nbsp;movie scene as&nbsp;the cover, making it&nbsp;recognizable for people who saw and liked the movie and encouraging them to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;the book.</p><p>Most books are printed on&nbsp;yellowish paper, and few have plain white pages&nbsp;— but why is&nbsp;that? Unless it’s a&nbsp;mass-market paperback edition, with paper that’s the same quality as&nbsp;a&nbsp;newspaper (meaning bad), it’s done with good quality paper. Don’t let the yellow hue confuse you. It’s usually called “crème,” and it’s a&nbsp;preference for any book because it’s less tiring on&nbsp;the reader’s eyes. The plain white paper is&nbsp;bleached, and it&nbsp;reflects a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;light, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;exhausting to&nbsp;read for a&nbsp;long time. So, that yellowish paper is&nbsp;the best paper, and publishers regularly use&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0e5/ca8/0672895934b3f98e582d5f2dc5.png><p>Another thing about books is&nbsp;those blank pages they often have at&nbsp;the very end. Their number depends on&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;pages in&nbsp;the book. The thing is&nbsp;that books are printed in&nbsp;signature. A&nbsp;signature is&nbsp;a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;pages that printers fold together and cut to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;book. A&nbsp;signature can have a&nbsp;different number of&nbsp;book pages, with the minimum being four and then with other numbers divisible by&nbsp;four.</p><p>So, a&nbsp;book that is&nbsp;300 pages long, in&nbsp;total, will fit in&nbsp;perfectly, and there will be&nbsp;no&nbsp;blank pages left. But if&nbsp;a&nbsp;book needs 303&nbsp;pages, it’ll need an&nbsp;additional signature, and the extra pages will remain blank&nbsp;— often marked with the word “notes” or&nbsp;with the message: “This page is&nbsp;intentionally left blank” to&nbsp;let the reader know that there’s no&nbsp;important information missing.</p><p>Ever wondered why most doctors have sloppy handwriting? No, there’s no&nbsp;class in&nbsp;medical colleges on&nbsp;bad handwriting. The reason why it’s so&nbsp;common is&nbsp;that doctors are always in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rush, and they write as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;keep their momentum, so&nbsp;there’s no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;care about writing nicely. Also, keep in&nbsp;mind that you’re not the only person who they write a&nbsp;prescription for over the course of&nbsp;a&nbsp;day. Doctors do&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;paperwork, working for 10&nbsp;hours straight, and they’re just too tired most of&nbsp;the time to&nbsp;give you a&nbsp;properly written note.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b84/23b/c509c65754b99d7d26e0dedcda.png><p>Have you noticed that most songs, in&nbsp;general, last somewhere between 3–4&nbsp;minutes? Well, originally, songs were being played on&nbsp;a&nbsp;phonograph record player&nbsp;— from a&nbsp;vinyl record&nbsp;— which was spinning at&nbsp;78&nbsp;revolutions per minute. So, the size of&nbsp;the vinyl record basically determined the length of&nbsp;the song.</p><p>There were two basic record sizes: a&nbsp;10-inch one, which had room for about three minutes of&nbsp;playtime, and a&nbsp;12-inch, which could fit a&nbsp;4-minute song. So, at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century, if&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist wanted their song played, they couldn’t make it&nbsp;longer than that if&nbsp;they wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;sell a&nbsp;record. Times have changed, but still, most songs are about 3–4 minutes long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9ce/b43/45f30e55bea1c28862427d600b.png><p>The initial reason for sticking to&nbsp;this pattern was also because of&nbsp;radio. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;song was too long, it&nbsp;would either get cut in&nbsp;half or&nbsp;some parts would be&nbsp;left off to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;fit into the 3-5 minute radio standard.</p><p>If&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist wanted the song on&nbsp;the radio, and if&nbsp;they wanted to&nbsp;earn money from&nbsp;it, they’d do&nbsp;their best to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;song that fits the standard so&nbsp;that the whole piece could be&nbsp;played without alterations. Today, even if&nbsp;there are longer songs, a&nbsp;3-4 minute song is&nbsp;now a&nbsp;tradition that artists typically stick&nbsp;to.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5us8SnrKKmlWK%2Fpq3SqKVmr5iueqPB0maqnpmkqHqivsRmmqiulaeypXnIp2SpmaSpsrO60maYp5xdZn1uuc6rnGarlZi%2FpsDSZm9qbGlog3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1409358-afriex-secures-12-million-y-combinator-asap-capital-future-africa-others-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Afriex secures $1.2 million from Y Combinator, ASAP Capital, Future Africa, Others">&larr;
