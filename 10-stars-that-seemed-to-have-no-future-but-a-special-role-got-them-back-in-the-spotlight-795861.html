Most of&nbsp;the time, these things happen after scandals, bad roles, or&nbsp;when viewers just get tired of&nbsp;your image on&nbsp;the screen. Some actors and actresses can’t handle these situations and disappear from the spotlight but others find enough power to&nbsp;keep going and prove they are still worth our attention. Sometimes, all it&nbsp;takes is&nbsp;just one role that can get you back to&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;your game.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;remember the films that gave a&nbsp;second life to&nbsp;our favorite actors and actresses.</p><p><h2>1. Joaquin Phoenix, The Master</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ee/4ee/8fb4275da69cd6a6d178cdef3e.jpg><p>Today, Phoenix is&nbsp;the winner of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Oscar and an&nbsp;idol for the public, but not so&nbsp;long ago, he&nbsp;was almost out of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> world completely. In&nbsp;2009, Joaquin and Casey Affleck decided to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;pretty controversial movie called <a href=#>I’m Still Here</a>. The idea was that for one year, Phoenix <strong>was supposed to&nbsp;act like an&nbsp;actor who was going crazy</strong>. And nobody was supposed to&nbsp;know about&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;stopped getting haircuts, started behaving in&nbsp;a&nbsp;really weird way, and said he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;start to&nbsp;compose rap songs. People started laughing at&nbsp;him and then everyone found out that it&nbsp;was <strong>an&nbsp;unusual project</strong>. Nobody actually liked the joke and the film was a&nbsp;failure.</p><p>For one year, the actor didn’t have a&nbsp;job, but then he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;the leading role in&nbsp;The Master and things started to&nbsp;improve for him. He&nbsp;did the role in&nbsp;such an&nbsp;amazing way, that nobody doubted his talent. Since then, his career has been on&nbsp;the upswing.</p><p><h2>2. Renée Zellweger, Judy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/841/711/f7a5115dcaa7b10dc0294d6037.jpg><p>Most people know Renée Zellweger for her role in&nbsp;the comedy movie Bridget Jones’s Diary. But then the actress appeared in&nbsp;the musical Chicago and everyone found out that Renée was also a&nbsp;great singer. Then, she got the Oscar for her role in&nbsp;Cold Mountain. And then, something went wrong: Zellweger had a&nbsp;ton of&nbsp;plastic surgery and became almost <a href=#>impossible to&nbsp;recognize</a>. It&nbsp;seemed that she had ended her career by&nbsp;herself.</p><p>But in&nbsp;2019, Renée made a&nbsp;comeback as&nbsp;a&nbsp;dramatic actress when she portrayed the role of&nbsp;the legendary Judy Garland in&nbsp;the biographical film, Judy. It&nbsp;seems that she did really well in&nbsp;this role. Critics already called this project a&nbsp;rebirth of&nbsp;the star and a&nbsp;big triumph.</p><p><h2>3. Matthew McConaughey, Dallas Buyers Club</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ade/d35/ca73a45ba38fbe47be6e9d8887.jpg><p>What did we&nbsp;know about <a href=# title="Matthew McConaughey" data-link=tag>Matthew McConaughey</a> before the 2010s? Only that he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;great body and a&nbsp;beautiful smile. So, he&nbsp;got similar roles: usually, he&nbsp;played <strong>attractive men</strong> in&nbsp;romantic comedies. At&nbsp;some point, producers and directors decided that this was the best he&nbsp;could&nbsp;do, so&nbsp;McConaughey didn’t get offered any serious roles for a&nbsp;long time. The only exception was <a href=#>The Lincoln Lawyer</a> but it&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;huge success.</p><p>The situation suddenly changed in&nbsp;2013 when Matthew played one of&nbsp;the main roles in&nbsp;<strong>Dallas Buyers Club, that won him an&nbsp;Oscar</strong>. After this triumph, everyone realized that he&nbsp;was back in&nbsp;the spotlight. After that, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;The Wolf of&nbsp;Wall Street, Interstellar, and of&nbsp;course, True Detective.</p><p><h2>4. Robin Wright, House of&nbsp;Cards</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f1/884/6263ae57d2abf9fc67b943daac.jpg><p>Robin Wright became widely famous for the role of&nbsp;Kelly in&nbsp;Santa Barbara. Later, she appeared in&nbsp;the iconic film Forrest Gump, where she played Jenny, the love interest of&nbsp;the main character. It&nbsp;seemed like this was just the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;long path to&nbsp;success, but it&nbsp;wasn’t. For several years, Robin appeared in&nbsp;average-quality films and disappeared from the focus of&nbsp;attention.</p><p>But in&nbsp;2013, Netflix producers offered Wright one of&nbsp;the leading roles in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series House of&nbsp;Cards. By&nbsp;that time, Robin didn’t have her long blonde hair, and her new haircut was even a&nbsp;great match for the strict and smart woman she would be&nbsp;playing. The series was incredibly successful and the role of&nbsp;Claire won Wright her Golden Globe.</p><p><h2>5. Tom Hardy, Bronson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ba/f89/42a40854f38a8346fd9778267d.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;believe now, but at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 2000s, <a href=# title="Tom Hardy" data-link=tag>Tom Hardy</a> was not a&nbsp;star. <strong>He&nbsp;mostly appeared in&nbsp;B-movies or&nbsp;in&nbsp;supporting roles</strong>. Everything changed in&nbsp;2008 when he&nbsp;played the main part in&nbsp;Bronson. In&nbsp;the film, Tom showed off his talent: he&nbsp;didn’t just transform by&nbsp;gaining more than <strong>30&nbsp;pounds, </strong>but he&nbsp;also did a&nbsp;great job acting too. He&nbsp;spent a&nbsp;long time <a href=#>communicating</a> with the dangerous criminal Bronson, that he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;portray.</p><p>His efforts were not for nothing and soon he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;3&nbsp;important movies: Inception, Warrior, and The Dark Knight Rises.</p><p><h2>6. Winona Ryder, Black Swan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e7/556/67adf350209b5b4561eb92fca3.jpg><p><a href=# title="Winona Ryder" data-link=tag>Winona Ryder</a>’s career had been going up&nbsp;since the end of&nbsp;the 80s. She played roles in&nbsp;very different movies. In&nbsp;2000, she appeared in&nbsp;the drama Autumn in&nbsp;New York, <strong>together with Richard Gere</strong> and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;huge success for her. But one year later, <strong>the actress was arrested</strong> and charged with shoplifting in&nbsp;Beverly Hills. The court sentenced her to&nbsp;pay a&nbsp;huge fine, do&nbsp;community service, and take classes. Of&nbsp;course, her career didn’t benefit from any of&nbsp;these things.</p><p>Director Darren Aronofsky helped Winona by&nbsp;offering her a&nbsp;small role in&nbsp;his Oscar-winning drama Black Swan. Despite the fact that she only <a href=#>appeared</a> for about 20&nbsp;minutes, it&nbsp;was this film that made producers pay attention to&nbsp;the actress. Now, Winona is&nbsp;the star of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Stranger Things" data-link=tag>Stranger Things</a>.</p><p><h2>7. Daniel Radcliffe, Swiss Army Man</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d92/b5b/d226a55903bf5c29f26b33db6f.jpg><p>When we&nbsp;think about <a href=# title="Daniel Radcliffe" data-link=tag>Daniel Radcliffe</a>, we&nbsp;instantly think about <a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not surprising because the young actor got the role of&nbsp;the wizard when he&nbsp;was only 11&nbsp;years old. And since then, Radcliffe had been trapped in&nbsp;this image. Neither the fans nor the producers <strong>could see him as&nbsp;anyone but Harry Potter</strong>. At&nbsp;some point, because of&nbsp;all the fame and attention, Radcliffe was stressed and started drinking. Many people even thought that nothing good was going to&nbsp;become of&nbsp;his career&nbsp;— after 8&nbsp;Harry Potter movies, Daniel appeared in&nbsp;very average roles.</p><p>Fortunately, in&nbsp;2016, the actor got a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very unusual film&nbsp;— Swiss Army Man. This project discovered his dramatic acting potential.</p><p><h2>8. Mandy Moore, This Is&nbsp;Us</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b0/a8a/d8995d5199b3e37e424c17bba5.jpg><p><a href=#>Mandy Moore</a> started her career <strong>as&nbsp;a&nbsp;singer</strong> and she got her first role in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie in&nbsp;2001. It&nbsp;was the teenage comedy The Princess Diaries. Then, she had the main roles in&nbsp;A&nbsp;Walk to&nbsp;Remember and American Dreamz. Even though she did a&nbsp;great job in&nbsp;these roles, her career wasn’t not progressing much. For years, Mandy only appeared in&nbsp;small roles in&nbsp;movies and series.</p><p>2016 was a&nbsp;breakthrough for the actress. NBC started a&nbsp;new series called This Is&nbsp;Us&nbsp;and Mandy got the main role. She showed both her acting and her singing skills in&nbsp;the series. She got her first nomination for the Golden Globe and got her star on&nbsp;the Hollywood Walk of&nbsp;Fame.</p><p><h2>9. Robert Pattinson, The Lost City of&nbsp;Z</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ea/423/c4498d50d09944799becce8009.jpg><p><a href=# title="Robert Pattinson" data-link=tag>Robert Pattinson</a> didn’t become successful right away&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was <strong>really hard for him to&nbsp;stop being so&nbsp;shy</strong>. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;problem in&nbsp;his early projects. But at&nbsp;some point, Pattinson decided to&nbsp;fight this problem: he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;model, started acting in&nbsp;the theater, and went to&nbsp;different auditions. Then, he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Goblet of&nbsp;Fire. And his true success was when he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;Twilight. But Pattinson didn’t want to&nbsp;get stuck in&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;Edward the vampire.</p><p>The actor spent several years trying to&nbsp;shake off the image of&nbsp;the perfect man. The adventure film The Lost City of&nbsp;Z really helped him with that. In&nbsp;the film, Pattinson played a&nbsp;very new role for him that the critics really loved and after that, he&nbsp;was offered a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;different roles.</p><p><h2>10. Steve Carell, Foxcatcher</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b7/336/c86f595eed896861ba4368c891.jpg><p>Steve Carell is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great comedian. During his entire career, <strong>he’s played pretty typical comedy roles</strong>. Some films got bad reviews, some got pretty good ones (Steve even won a&nbsp;Golden Globe) but producers still didn’t believe that he&nbsp;was good enough to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;more serious films.</p><p>But everything changed in&nbsp;2014 when Carell was offered a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;change directions and take part in&nbsp;the drama Foxcatcher. Everyone was so&nbsp;amazed when the actor did his job perfectly and played the cold millionaire, John du&nbsp;Pont. He&nbsp;was even nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar for this.</p><p><h2>11. Drew Barrymore, Charlie’s Angels</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b43/242/29386050f18c7892f048a816d7.jpg><p><a href=# title="Drew Barrymore" data-link=tag>Drew Barrymore</a> became popular back when she was a&nbsp;child: she played the main role in&nbsp;E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. <strong>Unfortunately, being popular at&nbsp;such a&nbsp;young age didn’t make her very happy</strong>&nbsp;— Drew was in&nbsp;rehab twice when she was 15&nbsp;years old. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;wonder that this story tainted the reputation of&nbsp;the actress and producers <strong>were not very eager to&nbsp;give her a&nbsp;job</strong>. But she wasn’t going to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;and she decided to&nbsp;show everyone that she could still be&nbsp;famous and successful.</p><p>The film The Wedding Singer helped her get back to&nbsp;the cinema world, but she became truly successful after the action film Charlie’s Angels was released. Since then, Barrymore has always been in&nbsp;the spotlight. Now, she is&nbsp;the star of&nbsp;Netflix’s Santa Clarita Diet.</p><p><h2>12. Gillian Anderson, <i>Hannibal</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/19e/8ce/22bec557508af089ee1f8c5c15.jpg><p>Gillian Anderson, famous for her role as&nbsp;Scully in&nbsp;The X-Files, <strong>didn’t actually like this role</strong>. According to&nbsp;her, it&nbsp;took a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;her energy and time. Yes, it&nbsp;was Scully that made her incredibly popular, but it&nbsp;was this same role that almost ruined her career. <strong>She even had to&nbsp;eventually leave the&nbsp;US and go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK</strong> to&nbsp;act in&nbsp;the theater and enjoy more serious projects.</p><p>It&nbsp;was her role in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series Hannibal that got her back on&nbsp;the screen. She played the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;psychotherapist. She was different and way more elegant, making her the perfect choice for this role. By&nbsp;season&nbsp;3, her character was one of&nbsp;the leads in&nbsp;the series. Now, Anderson is&nbsp;actively taking part in&nbsp;movies and series.</p><p><h2>13. Michael Keaton, <i>Birdman</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/124/df3/17661b548594061d0f01b00c84.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the ’80s, Keaton became famous for his iconic <strong>role as&nbsp;Batman in&nbsp;Tim Burton’s films</strong>. But after that, his career went into a&nbsp;slump: he&nbsp;very rarely appeared in&nbsp;movies and they were not really successful. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;wonder that he&nbsp;disappeared from the spotlight and developed a&nbsp;reputation as&nbsp;<strong>the actor of&nbsp;one role</strong>.</p><p>But in&nbsp;2014, he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;comeback to&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;big movies in&nbsp;Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Birdman. Interestingly, in&nbsp;Birdman, he&nbsp;basically played himself. He&nbsp;was an&nbsp;actor that got trapped in&nbsp;one role. This is&nbsp;probably why he&nbsp;did such a&nbsp;great job. After this success, Michael was invited to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the film Spotlight and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Homecoming.</p><p><h2>14. Reese Witherspoon, <i>Wild</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/202/302/e634e051e59bc54fa8923818af.jpg><p>The comedy film Legally Blonde made Reese Witherspoon famous and successful. She got her Golden Globe for this film and <strong>Elle Woods became her iconic role</strong>. Soon after that, a&nbsp;sequel was released that was also very successful in&nbsp;the box-office and this meant that Witherspoon was doomed to&nbsp;play the same role over and over again. It’s not that she didn’t have any other offers, but she just had a&nbsp;hard time discovering her full potential for a&nbsp;long time.</p><p>In&nbsp;2014, she agreed to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;the film <a href=#>Wild</a> based on&nbsp;the <strong>autobiographical book by&nbsp;Cheryl Strayed</strong>. In&nbsp;the film, she decides to&nbsp;walk more than 1,000 miles alone in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;heal her trauma after a&nbsp;divorce and the death of&nbsp;her mother. It&nbsp;was this project that allowed the world to&nbsp;see Reese Witherspoon as&nbsp;a&nbsp;great dramatic actress. Since then, she has appeared in&nbsp;very powerful projects, like Big Little Lies and, most recently, Apple’s new release The Morning Show.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these comebacks seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most impressive for you? Maybe you have some other similar examples?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xedKtmKurXam1osCMrJyepZWZerW7jKGYr51do7xustStrKudXZfCtXnAZqqpnZOerq150aijnmWXpMFuwMeepGaakZi4brXNZquhnV2ovbDAy6KeoaxdbIZ2hJVqZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./11-signs-that-show-youre-getting-older-745210.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11 Signs That Show Youre Getting Older">&larr;
