There’s so&nbsp;much social pressure on&nbsp;celebrities to&nbsp;have the perfect body, and the thought that the slightest sign of&nbsp;aging or&nbsp;any other thing is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;“flaw” makes them go&nbsp;crazy and look for extreme solutions. Thankfully this is&nbsp;changing nowadays, mainly because there are many courageous celebrities who’ve decided to&nbsp;move away from the canons of&nbsp;beauty imposed by&nbsp;others in&nbsp;an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;love themselves just the way they are.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> made a&nbsp;list with 10&nbsp;of&nbsp;these celebrities that went under the knife at&nbsp;first and later on&nbsp;realized they didn’t need <a href=# title="plastic surgery" data-link=tag>plastic surgery</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;beautiful, because it’s what’s inside that counts.</p><p><h2>1. Nicole Kidman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/87f/925/142d9b504fa4b02a804ed2b5c6.jpg><p>Years ago, <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a> tried <a href=# title=Botox data-link=tag>Botox</a> injections, but when she noticed that she lost those facial expressions that made her so&nbsp;recognizable as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress, she regretted doing&nbsp;it. During an&nbsp;interview, she <a href=#>confessed</a>: “No&nbsp;surgery for&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;did try Botox, unfortunately, but&nbsp;I got out of&nbsp;it&nbsp;and now&nbsp;I can finally move my&nbsp;face again.” Nowadays she prefers to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;her beauty without any sort of&nbsp;medical interventions: “I&nbsp;use sunscreen and&nbsp;I take care of&nbsp;myself (...) I&nbsp;think the important thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;good shape.”</p><p><h2>2. Michelle Renaud</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c9/02d/fb38555771aaea6b7f825e9d05.jpg><p>Actress <a href=#>Michelle Renaud</a> decided to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;her breast implants and proudly shared a&nbsp;<a href=#>post</a> on&nbsp;social media explaining what her reasoning was: “I&nbsp;realized that having implants did not fit with my&nbsp;self-esteem, nor my&nbsp;lifestyle (...) it&nbsp;doesn’t make me&nbsp;any more or&nbsp;less flat, and neither does it&nbsp;make you! I&nbsp;feel prettier than&nbsp;I did before now that&nbsp;I removed them.”</p><p>Renaud also confessed that there was another important reason that drove her to&nbsp;change her mind about breast implants. This was related, in&nbsp;fact, to&nbsp;something much more important than just appearance: she was also afraid that the implants could have side effects, which is&nbsp;why she decided to&nbsp;prioritize her <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a>.</p><p><h2>3. Courteney Cox</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9d/0aa/7d1cd45c1bacd0d8518b370a52.jpg><p>At&nbsp;some point, <a href=# title="Courteney Cox" data-link=tag>Courteney Cox</a> became worried that because she was aging, she would no&nbsp;longer be&nbsp;offered as&nbsp;many roles as&nbsp;before. “I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;thinking appearance was the most important thing. That as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;I looked OK, I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;OK, which got me&nbsp;into trouble,” she explained when she was asked why she used Botox in&nbsp;the first place.</p><p>“Well, what would end up&nbsp;happening is&nbsp;that you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor who would say, “You look great, but what would help is&nbsp;a&nbsp;little injection here or&nbsp;filler there.” So&nbsp;you walk out and you don’t look so&nbsp;bad and you think, no&nbsp;one noticed—it’s good. Then somebody tells you about another doctor: “This person’s amazing. They do&nbsp;this person who looks so&nbsp;natural.” You meet them and they say, “You should just do&nbsp;this.” The next thing you know, you’re layered and layered and layered. You have no&nbsp;idea because it’s gradual until you&nbsp;go, “Oh, this doesn’t look right.” she said during an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a>. Today Courteney has gotten rid of&nbsp;anything that isn’t natural and she’s looking forward to&nbsp;aging naturally and to&nbsp;showing the world that she’s proud of&nbsp;it&nbsp;by&nbsp;not hiding the passage of&nbsp;time.</p><p><h2>4. Melanie Griffith</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb7/e7f/3f56d451339a46b805973923e8.jpg><p>Melanie Griffith <a href=#>confessed</a> that she didn’t notice her excessive use of&nbsp;Botox until people started talking behind her back about her looks and surgeries. When it&nbsp;finally sank&nbsp;in, she couldn’t help but ask herself, “My&nbsp;God, what have I&nbsp;done?” It&nbsp;was then that she decided to&nbsp;back up&nbsp;and ask for medical help to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the Botox once and for all: “Hopefully, I&nbsp;look more normal now,” she said.</p><p><h2>5. Jane Fonda</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/914/4bd/78637c5b8d90bb38c9a0df5800.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jane Fonda" data-link=tag>Jane Fonda</a> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the actresses who has not been shy about admitting that, in&nbsp;the past, she had surgeries to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;young and fresh look. Even though she had <a href=#>implants</a> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age, years later she had them removed. Still, this was far from being the last time she faced the operating table. But in&nbsp;the last year or&nbsp;so, Fonda decided she would no&nbsp;longer have any more surgeries and explained how difficult it&nbsp;was for her to&nbsp;make that decision:</p><p>“I&nbsp;can’t pretend that I’m not vain, but there isn’t going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;any more plastic surgery—I’m not going to&nbsp;cut myself up&nbsp;anymore, I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;work every day to&nbsp;be&nbsp;self-accepting. It&nbsp;doesn’t come easy to&nbsp;me.” However, she often posts pictures on&nbsp;her social media where she opens up&nbsp;and shows her natural looks&nbsp;— to&nbsp;share with the rest of&nbsp;the world the true Fonda, who lies behind all the glamour of&nbsp;a&nbsp;legendary actress. It’s, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, part of&nbsp;the process of&nbsp;falling in&nbsp;love with her true self.</p><p><h2>6. Jamie Lee Curtis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af3/165/70dddc57a7ae93d253d87fd87d.jpg><p>Actress <a href=# title="Jamie Lee Curtis" data-link=tag>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> <a href=#>revealed</a> that while shooting the movie <a href=#>Perfect</a>, in&nbsp;1985, she felt compelled to&nbsp;have surgery to&nbsp;make herself look more beautiful. She also said that after that first time, other visits to&nbsp;the operating table followed. However, instead of&nbsp;making her feel better about herself and her looks, plastic surgery managed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;exactly the opposite, according to&nbsp;her own <a href=#>statement</a>: “I’ve had a&nbsp;little lipo(suction), I’ve had a&nbsp;little Botox,” she told the American magazine More. “And you know what? None of&nbsp;it&nbsp;works. None of&nbsp;it.” Today she says she feels satisfied with how she looks with all her physical features, including the lines and the wrinkles.</p><p><h2>7. Victoria Beckham</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/48f/28b/f2a56c5f618c80ffbc505034c2.jpg><p>Designer and singer Victoria Beckham denied for a&nbsp;long time that she had had breast implants. She finally confessed to&nbsp;having them when she decided to&nbsp;have them <a href=#>removed</a>: “All those years&nbsp;I denied it&nbsp;— foolish. A&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;insecurity,” and she advised people to&nbsp;not repeat her mistakes: “Just celebrate what you’ve got.”</p><p><h2>8. Heather Morris</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d33/284/35856b5bf4b3f16ca91781cfa1.jpg><p>For a&nbsp;long time actress Heather Morris denied having implants. It&nbsp;was only when she had them <a href=#>removed</a> that she confessed to&nbsp;having them in&nbsp;the first place. However, in&nbsp;her case, she decided to&nbsp;have them removed for reasons of&nbsp;practicality and because they were already part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;stage of&nbsp;her life that was now over: “’It was hard being active with them, because my&nbsp;chest was always sore. It&nbsp;hurt a&nbsp;lot, and&nbsp;I didn’t like being in&nbsp;pain. Implants were something&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;I wanted when&nbsp;I was younger, and now&nbsp;I don’t.” She told herself “they have to&nbsp;go,” and now she is&nbsp;very happy with her choice.</p><p><h2>9. Ashley Tisdale</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/688/43c/4b690b566891374d10d8d91788.jpg><p>Ashley Tisdale decided to&nbsp;break the news to&nbsp;her fans that she used to&nbsp;have breast implants and her subsequent decision to&nbsp;have them removed in&nbsp;what she called “probably the most personal <a href=#>post</a> she’s ever shared.” There she explained that she had the surgery in&nbsp;the first place because, “prior to&nbsp;the surgery, I&nbsp;constantly felt my&nbsp;body was less than, and thought this change would make me&nbsp;feel more whole and more secure about myself. And for a&nbsp;short period of&nbsp;time...it did.”</p><p>But then, her decision came with lots of&nbsp;physical discomfort and even health problems. After giving it&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;thought, she came to&nbsp;the conclusion that she didn’t need those implants to&nbsp;feel fully realized and went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;have them removed: “This journey has been one of&nbsp;growth, self-discovery, self-acceptance, and most importantly self-love. (...) After my&nbsp;explant surgery and&nbsp;I think you can tell just how happy I&nbsp;am to&nbsp;finally be&nbsp;fully&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>10. Cameron Diaz</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c4/1c5/704d775330804cde94d3fd598e.jpg><p>This beautiful actress <a href=#>admitted</a> to&nbsp;having tried plastic surgery, and said that she was disappointed with the results: “I’ve tried [Botox] before, where it&nbsp;was like [a] little tiny touch of&nbsp;something. It&nbsp;changed my&nbsp;face in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;weird way that&nbsp;I was like, ’No, I&nbsp;don’t want&nbsp;to [be] like [that]’ ... I’d rather see my&nbsp;face aging than a&nbsp;face that doesn’t belong to&nbsp;me&nbsp;at&nbsp;all.” She also admitted that she is&nbsp;very proud of&nbsp;the expression lines that are visible on&nbsp;her face because they are a&nbsp;sign that she has smiled a&nbsp;lot during her lifetime: “This means, I’ve smiled my&nbsp;whole life. I&nbsp;love life. I’m happy&nbsp;I don’t have a&nbsp;problem with that.”</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think that <a href=# title="natural beauty" data-link=tag>natural beauty</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important thing to&nbsp;preserve or&nbsp;do&nbsp;you think that plastic surgery can actually make people feel more comfortable in&nbsp;their skin?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xecKeo56aop7BqrHSZq6hp12ZsqS1w56bZqyfYrSwecGamqRlpKR6r63TrqmapF2XsqLB07Jkmp6kmr9uwNGyoKefXaW5or%2FToppmq6WntKa%2B2GZvaWhmbYVw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ways-to-say-hello-in-english.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11 ways to say hello in English - Lingoda">&larr;
