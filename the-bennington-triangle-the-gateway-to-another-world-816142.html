Don’t get too excited, though, there’s a&nbsp;catch. If&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;tackle the Long Trail, don’t go&nbsp;alone. Why? Well, let’s just say that if&nbsp;you wear red, you might end up&nbsp;being the star of&nbsp;a&nbsp;real-life vanishing act.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d59/8ff/4279af51ebb2cfacc71438a2ee.png><p>Glastenbury Mountain, nestled in&nbsp;beautiful Bennington County, Vermont, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Green Mountain National Forest. Its summit, though, is&nbsp;where things get a&nbsp;bit... well, peculiar. For starters, the surrounding region was dubbed “The Bennington Triangle” and for good reason. All sorts of&nbsp;strange things happened here on&nbsp;the mountain and in&nbsp;the nearby towns. We’re talking about spaceship sightings, encounters with the legendary bigfoot, mysterious lights dancing in&nbsp;the sky, and even the vanishing of&nbsp;five people between the years nineteen forty-five and nineteen-fifty.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the locals, there is&nbsp;some sort of&nbsp;explanation, but it’s not because of&nbsp;the weather, rough terrain, or&nbsp;wild animals. Legend has it&nbsp;that this region is&nbsp;home to&nbsp;a&nbsp;treacherous Man-Eating Stone. Apparently, this rock had a&nbsp;serious appetite and would trap anyone unfortunate enough to&nbsp;step on&nbsp;it. As&nbsp;you can imagine, people did their best to&nbsp;steer clear of&nbsp;this stone. But of&nbsp;course, humans being humans, some early settlers couldn’t resist the temptation. The towns of&nbsp;Glastenbury and Somerset used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;bustling logging towns, supplying lumber and trees. But as&nbsp;time went&nbsp;on, the industry took a&nbsp;nosedive and the forest started thinning out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/859/fdc/8a712256ae9cf3de7d4c8f20f1.png><p>Glastenbury had a&nbsp;brief stint as&nbsp;a&nbsp;summer tourist resort, but things took a&nbsp;turn for the worse after just one year. A&nbsp;tragic flood in&nbsp;eighteen ninety-eight washed away all the railroad lines and bridges, leaving the town in&nbsp;shambles. Sadly, it&nbsp;never managed to&nbsp;bounce back. These days, Glastenbury and Somerset are nowhere near what they used to&nbsp;be, and <a href=# title=nature data-link=tag>nature</a> gracefully took over, leaving only cellar holes as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder of&nbsp;the people who once called this place home.</p><p>What about those people that went missing? It&nbsp;all started with Middie Rivers, a&nbsp;seasoned seventy-four-year-old mountain guide. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;fateful November day in&nbsp;nineteen forty-five, Rivers was leading a&nbsp;group through Hell Hollow, a&nbsp;chillingly named area in&nbsp;the southwest woods of&nbsp;Glastenbury. As&nbsp;the group made their way back to&nbsp;camp, Rivers mysteriously got ahead of&nbsp;everyone and, you guessed&nbsp;it, vanished into thin air. Naturally, authorities and concerned volunteers sprang into action. They scoured the vast wilderness of&nbsp;Glastenbury Mountain for eight days, hoping to&nbsp;unravel the mystery. They found no&nbsp;trace of&nbsp;Middie Rivers, not even a&nbsp;clue as&nbsp;to&nbsp;what could have happened.</p><p>Now, fast-forward to&nbsp;a&nbsp;year later. An&nbsp;eighteen-year-old sophomore from Bennington College named Paula Welden was dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;flashy red jacket when she embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;hike along the Long Trail. Little did she know that her choice of&nbsp;attire would become an&nbsp;infamous part of&nbsp;the legend. Spoiler alert: wearing red on&nbsp;the Long Trail turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;big no-no. It’s no&nbsp;surprise by&nbsp;now that Paula simply vanished. This time, the extensive search party grew to&nbsp;include over a&nbsp;thousand. The skies were scoured by&nbsp;aircraft and a&nbsp;generous reward was offered, too. Despite their best efforts, not a&nbsp;single clue surfaced yet again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4ad/0d1/ea58ed5a4a868f024dba1b7b08.png><p>Unusual disappearances have always captured our attention. This next story takes&nbsp;us even further back in&nbsp;time, to&nbsp;the year nineteen hundred. And it&nbsp;starts with a&nbsp;steamboat called the Archer cruising past <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>the Flannan Islands, in&nbsp;Scotland</u></a>. At&nbsp;one point during the trip, the captain noticed something fishy. The lighthouse had gone dark, which was extremely unusual.</p><p>Well, the captain wasn’t about to&nbsp;keep this mysterious disappearance to&nbsp;himself. He&nbsp;reported it&nbsp;straight to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Scottish data-link=tag>Scottish</a> Coast Guard. But here’s the kicker&nbsp;— a&nbsp;big ol’ <a href=# title=storm data-link=tag>storm</a> decided to&nbsp;crash the party and made it&nbsp;impossible for anyone to&nbsp;investigate what had happened to&nbsp;that lighthouse fire. What we&nbsp;do&nbsp;know is&nbsp;that there were three men in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;keeping the lighthouse fire. And mind you, they were no&nbsp;rookies. They were experienced lighthouse keepers. Something surely must have happened to&nbsp;them to&nbsp;prevent these men from fulfilling their duty. Soon enough, Scottish officials finally made their way to&nbsp;the island, 11&nbsp;days after the lighthouse light disappeared.</p><p>The first thing they noticed was that there was a&nbsp;whole feast just sitting there in&nbsp;the kitchen, untouched. It’s like the lighthouse keepers were in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;supper and suddenly decided to&nbsp;bail. Officials also found an&nbsp;upturned chair. Did someone get spooked? Was there a&nbsp;sudden surge of&nbsp;dance fever? Some tools had also gone missing, and there weren’t enough jackets in&nbsp;the wardrobe. Authorities also decided to&nbsp;dig into the log diary, where they were surprised to&nbsp;find information about a&nbsp;storm! It&nbsp;turns out there was a&nbsp;raging tempest near the islands that night. However, there were no&nbsp;official reports of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;colossal storm in&nbsp;the area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/987/28b/2385dc55e8a801f606677b06c8.png><p>The official version of&nbsp;events, according to&nbsp;the experts, was this: A&nbsp;storm hit, and our brave lighthouse keepers sprang into action. Two of&nbsp;them decided it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;fortify the fencing, ready to&nbsp;face the storm head-on. But just when they thought they had it&nbsp;all under control, the water levels shot&nbsp;up, and they were swept away by&nbsp;the waves. The third lighthouse keeper obviously must have rushed to&nbsp;their aid. Chances are he&nbsp;too suffered the same watery fate.</p><p>It’s not just people that suddenly go&nbsp;missing in&nbsp;the wild. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>What about a&nbsp;lost treasure, hidden in&nbsp;the Superstitious Mountains of&nbsp;Arizona?</u></a> This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stunning range of&nbsp;mountains located in&nbsp;the eastern part of&nbsp;Phoenix. And trust&nbsp;me, these mountains have quite the reputation. The most infamous tale of&nbsp;them all? The legend of&nbsp;the Lost Dutchman’s Gold Mine!</p><p>Back in&nbsp;the nineteenth century, there was a&nbsp;man named Jacob Waltz. He&nbsp;stumbled upon a&nbsp;massive goldmine within these mountains and, of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;became known as&nbsp;the “Lost Dutchman’s Gold Mine.” Now, old Waltz was a&nbsp;crafty one. He&nbsp;found this treasure trove of&nbsp;gold and decided to&nbsp;keep its location a&nbsp;top secret. So, he&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;Arizona in&nbsp;the eighteen-sixties and lived there until the end of&nbsp;his days. But here’s where things get interesting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dd9/b5e/439a62564da8044d32fc3ce4d7.png><p>In&nbsp;eighteen ninety-one, a&nbsp;terrible flood swept through Phoenix and wreaked havoc on&nbsp;Waltz’s farm, among many others. Tragically, he&nbsp;fell ill and passed away. However, it’s what happened on&nbsp;his last that truly sets the stage for our tale. As&nbsp;the story goes, Waltz decided to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;confession to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lady named Julia Thomas, who had been nursing him.</p><p>Waltz spilled the beans about the gold mine hidden in&nbsp;the Superstition Mountains. He&nbsp;even went the extra mile and drew a&nbsp;rough map, describing the route to&nbsp;this treasure trove. Soon enough, a&nbsp;local newspaper decided to&nbsp;embark on&nbsp;a&nbsp;grand adventure to&nbsp;find this elusive mine. Julia and a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;brave souls join the expedition, hoping to&nbsp;strike it&nbsp;rich. But alas, despite their best efforts, they came back empty-handed.</p><p>Now, here’s the hilarious part. Julia and her buddies, feeling a&nbsp;bit hopeless and realizing they couldn’t find the gold mine, decide to&nbsp;sell copies of&nbsp;the maps for a&nbsp;measly seven dollars each. They went from having visions of&nbsp;gold-plated mansions to&nbsp;hawking maps like street vendors. Hey, desperate times call for desperate measures, right?</p><p>Now, let’s fast-forward to&nbsp;the summer of&nbsp;nineteen thirty-one. Enter Adolph Ruth, an&nbsp;amateur treasure hunter with dreams of&nbsp;striking it&nbsp;rich. Armed with a&nbsp;twinkle in&nbsp;his eye, he&nbsp;set off to&nbsp;conquer the Superstition Mountains in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;that elusive Dutchman’s Gold Mine. But alas, things took a&nbsp;dark turn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3ab/1c0/b5aed95a9a98d1efb0d51b3ce5.png><p>After roaming around those rugged peaks, poor old Adolph mysteriously vanished into thin air. News of&nbsp;this strange incident spread, capturing the attention of&nbsp;the entire nation. Suddenly, everyone wanted to&nbsp;know more about the Lost Dutchman’s Gold Mine.</p><p>Over the years, countless adventurers have tried their luck in&nbsp;the Superstition Mountains. But you’ve surely guessed it&nbsp;by&nbsp;now: The gold remains hidden to&nbsp;this day. But did it&nbsp;ever exist?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYybnKemmaO0tbvNZquroZGjtK2xjK2fnmWXlsGmw8CyZK2nXZa7sMDHnqlmr5%2BnuaV5l2ptamxiZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-most-shocking-elimination-of-the-season-our-dwts-semi-finals-recap.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The MOST SHOCKING Elimination of the Season!">&larr;
