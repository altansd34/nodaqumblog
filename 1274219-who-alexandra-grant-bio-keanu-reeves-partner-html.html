Her work is fueled by the need to understand how the images we see and languages we speak influence how we think and exchange ideas. She also seeks to answer how writers and artists can influence culture in a rapidly growing technology-based world.</p><h2>Profile summary</h2><ul><li><strong>Full name: </strong>Alexandra Grant</li><li><strong>Year of birth: </strong>1973</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 46 years</li><li><strong>Profession:</strong> Artist</li><li><strong>Nationality: </strong>American</li></ul><h2>Her early life</h2><p class=align-left>Grant was born in Fairview Park, Ohio, in 1973. <a href=# title="Alexander Grant artist" rel="nofollow noopener">Her parents</a>, a political science professor and a Scottish geology professor, were fond of travelling to different parts of the world.

The actor surprised fans by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">holding Alexandra Grant’s hand</a> at the event, sending a clear message of the nature of their relationship. Alexandra Grant Keanu reeves have collaborated before on two books; <i>Shadows </i>and <i>Ode to Happiness</i>.

In Keanu's 2011 book, <i>Ode to Happiness,</i> she played the role of the illustrator. Amazon describes the book as a grown-up’s picture book that serves as a reminder not to take ourselves too seriously.</p><p class=align-left>In collaboration with Janey Bergam, the book features her drawings, with texts written by Reeves. Its theme is making the best of a bad situation. Interestingly, it retails for over $800, possibly as a result of a limited print run.</p><p class=align-left>In 2016, the actor and the artist teamed up again for the book, <i>Shadows.</i> This book explores both the symbolic and real nature of the shadow as a figure of speech and image. Sometimes, Grant captures Reeves’ shadow as a silhouette, while at other times, she captures it as traces of light as he moves along with the camera. Working together could have been a contributing factor to the development of deeper feelings between them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fc6b7142d39250c7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting details about the life, career and relationships of Jennifer Tilly</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0d5762bfbba62e58.jpg><p class=align-left>In 2017, the two started a niche publishing company called X Artist’s Books. The goal of the company is to publish high-quality, thoughtful, and artist-centred books. The two assert that their books are works of art, treasured companions, portals to imagined worlds, and the fabric of a community.</p><p class=align-left>The public display of affection at the LACMA Art + Film Gala made their fans curious. How long has the romantic relationship lasted? <a href=# title="Alexandra Grant" rel="nofollow noopener">One source</a> claimed that they have been dating since the summer of 2017, while another claimed that they started dating earlier this year.</p><h3>Partners who help each other</h3><p class=align-left>Keanu Reeves has undergone a <a href=# title="Alexandra Grant" rel="nofollow noopener">couple of tragedies</a> in his life. Most fans were happy to see him with a woman in public after a long time. The actor lost his ex-girlfriend, Jeniffer, back in 2001. The two had been in a serious relationship, which was followed by the birth of their daughter, Ava, in 1999. They broke up shortly after Ava's birth. Jeniffer died in an accident at the young age of 28 years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ac154f8516b38a76.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top facts about the man behind Today show Al Roker</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Alexander Grant artist was one of the few people who were able to connect with Keanu after his loss.

She is described as a good communicator, spiritual, warm, and kind.</p><p class=align-left>Is it safe to refer to Keanu Reeves as Alexandra Grant husband? Maybe later, hopefully! For now, he is Alexandra Grant partner, and the two have not disclosed much about their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/29c240e392b78e7f.jpg><p class=align-left>Alexandra Grant is an incredible artist who has exhibited her work in high-profile events and galleries.
