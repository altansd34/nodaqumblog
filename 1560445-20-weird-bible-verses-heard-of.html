She wanted men who behaved like animals in their sexual desire.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Meaning</strong>: This scripture illustrates how Israel forgot God's ways and emulated the nearby nations' ungodly practices.

And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; therefore, He killed him also.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Meaning</strong>: This is among the strangest Bible verses that will surprise you.

Rowdy men storm a celebration and demand a man to be handed over to them.

As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. “Get out of here, baldy!” they said. “Get out of here, baldy!” He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then, two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Meaning</strong>: Elisha, the prophet of God, is mocked by a group of young men.
