Her dance-related injuries influenced the decision. Ever since her first appearance in a 1991 commercial, she remained consistent until she suddenly left Hollywood.</p><h3>Why did Neve Campbell leave Hollywood?</h3><p class=align-left>According to the actress, she left because she needed a break from the famous lifestyle. In her words, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she said</a>:</p>I needed a minute. In my 20s, it all hit so fast and so big that it was a little overwhelming. Wonderful, obviously, and I'm very grateful for it, but it got to a level, also, where the kinds of things that I was being offered were not the things I wanted to do. I was constantly being offered horror films, because I was known for horror films, or bad romantic comedies.<p class=align-left>Before her break, Neve Campbell and Denise Richards were famous for their erotic thriller <i>Wild Things</i>. The 1998 movie featured one of those rare Neve Campbell hot scenes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/14ab2f9dc5efa006.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top facts about Marie Avgeropoulos: Background, career, love life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The scene which caused a lot of stir and rumours on lesbianism was the Neve Campbell Denise Richards kiss in the pool. Nonetheless, both actresses have had marriages over the years, which invalidated the speculation.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Popular magazines</a> like UK’s EMPIRE and FHM recognised the attractive Canadian in their exclusive list. EMPIRE placed her at the third spot in their 1998 list featuring 100 sexiest movie stars.
